Savitri<br>
a Legend and a Symbol<br>
<br>
Publisher’s Note<br>
The writing of Savitri extended over much of the<br>
later part of Sri Aurobindo’s life. The earliest known<br>
manuscript is dated 1916. The original narrative poem<br>
was recast several times in the first phase of composition.<br>
By around 1930, Sri Aurobindo had begun to turn it<br>
into an epic with a larger scope and deeper significance.<br>
Transformed into “A Legend and a Symbol”, Savitri<br>
became his major literary work which he continued to<br>
expand and perfect until his last days. In the late 1940s,<br>
when his eyesight was failing, he took the help of a scribe<br>
and dictated the extensive final stages of revision.<br>
Separate cantos started to appear in print in 1946.<br>
Part One of the first edition was published in 1950. The<br>
next year, after Sri Aurobindo’s passing, the rest of the<br>
poem was brought out in a second volume.<br>
In the second edition (1954), Sri Aurobindo’s letters<br>
on Savitri were added. They are omitted from the present<br>
edition and included in Letters on Poetry and Art.<br>
The present text is that of the fourth (“revised”) edition which came out in 1993. Each line has been checked<br>
to eliminate any unintentional discrepancies between the<br>
final manuscript or dictation and the printed form of the<br>
poem.<br>

1916 version of a passage in Book Nine, Canto One<br>
<br>
A page of a 1947 draft for Book Ten, Canto Four<br>
<br>
Author’s Note<br>
The tale of Satyavan and Savitri is recited in the Mahabharata<br>
as a story of conjugal love conquering death. But this legend<br>
is, as shown by many features of the human tale, one of the<br>
many symbolic myths of the Vedic cycle. Satyavan is the soul<br>
carrying the divine truth of being within itself but descended<br>
into the grip of death and ignorance; Savitri is the Divine Word,<br>
daughter of the Sun, goddess of the supreme Truth who comes<br>
down and is born to save; Aswapati, the Lord of the Horse, her<br>
human father, is the Lord of Tapasya, the concentrated energy<br>
of spiritual endeavour that helps us to rise from the mortal to<br>
the immortal planes; Dyumatsena, Lord of the Shining Hosts,<br>
father of Satyavan, is the Divine Mind here fallen blind, losing<br>
its celestial kingdom of vision, and through that loss its kingdom<br>
of glory. Still this is not a mere allegory, the characters are not<br>
personified qualities, but incarnations or emanations of living<br>
and conscious Forces with whom we can enter into concrete<br>
touch and they take human bodies in order to help man and<br>
show him the way from his mortal state to a divine consciousness<br>
and immortal life.<br>

The Symbol Dawn<br>
IT WAS the hour before the Gods awake.<br>
Across the path of the divine Event<br>
The huge foreboding mind of Night, alone<br>
In her unlit temple of eternity,<br>
Lay stretched immobile upon Silence’ marge.<br>
Almost one felt, opaque, impenetrable,<br>
In the sombre symbol of her eyeless muse<br>
The abysm of the unbodied Infinite;<br>
A fathomless zero occupied the world.<br>
A power of fallen boundless self awake<br>
Between the first and the last Nothingness,<br>
Recalling the tenebrous womb from which it came,<br>
Turned from the insoluble mystery of birth<br>
And the tardy process of mortality<br>
And longed to reach its end in vacant Nought.<br>
As in a dark beginning of all things,<br>
A mute featureless semblance of the Unknown<br>
Repeating for ever the unconscious act,<br>
Prolonging for ever the unseeing will,<br>
Cradled the cosmic drowse of ignorant Force<br>
Whose moved creative slumber kindles the suns<br>
And carries our lives in its somnambulist whirl.<br>
Athwart the vain enormous trance of Space,<br>
Its formless stupor without mind or life,<br>
A shadow spinning through a soulless Void,<br>
Thrown back once more into unthinking dreams,<br>
Earth wheeled abandoned in the hollow gulfs<br>
Forgetful of her spirit and her fate.<br>
The impassive skies were neutral, empty, still.<br>
Then something in the inscrutable darkness stirred;<br>
A nameless movement, an unthought Idea<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
Insistent, dissatisfied, without an aim,<br>
Something that wished but knew not how to be,<br>
Teased the Inconscient to wake Ignorance.<br>
A throe that came and left a quivering trace,<br>
Gave room for an old tired want unfilled,<br>
At peace in its subconscient moonless cave<br>
To raise its head and look for absent light,<br>
Straining closed eyes of vanished memory,<br>
Like one who searches for a bygone self<br>
And only meets the corpse of his desire.<br>
It was as though even in this Nought’s profound,<br>
Even in this ultimate dissolution’s core,<br>
There lurked an unremembering entity,<br>
Survivor of a slain and buried past<br>
Condemned to resume the effort and the pang,<br>
Reviving in another frustrate world.<br>
An unshaped consciousness desired light<br>
And a blank prescience yearned towards distant change.<br>
As if a childlike finger laid on a cheek<br>
Reminded of the endless need in things<br>
The heedless Mother of the universe,<br>
An infant longing clutched the sombre Vast.<br>
Insensibly somewhere a breach began:<br>
A long lone line of hesitating hue<br>
Like a vague smile tempting a desert heart<br>
Troubled the far rim of life’s obscure sleep.<br>
Arrived from the other side of boundlessness<br>
An eye of deity peered through the dumb deeps;<br>
A scout in a reconnaissance from the sun,<br>
It seemed amid a heavy cosmic rest,<br>
The torpor of a sick and weary world,<br>
To seek for a spirit sole and desolate<br>
Too fallen to recollect forgotten bliss.<br>
Intervening in a mindless universe,<br>
Its message crept through the reluctant hush<br>
Calling the adventure of consciousness and joy<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Symbol Dawn<br>
<br>
And, conquering Nature’s disillusioned breast,<br>
Compelled renewed consent to see and feel.<br>
A thought was sown in the unsounded Void,<br>
A sense was born within the darkness’ depths,<br>
A memory quivered in the heart of Time<br>
As if a soul long dead were moved to live:<br>
But the oblivion that succeeds the fall,<br>
Had blotted the crowded tablets of the past,<br>
And all that was destroyed must be rebuilt<br>
And old experience laboured out once more.<br>
All can be done if the god-touch is there.<br>
A hope stole in that hardly dared to be<br>
Amid the Night’s forlorn indifference.<br>
As if solicited in an alien world<br>
With timid and hazardous instinctive grace,<br>
Orphaned and driven out to seek a home,<br>
An errant marvel with no place to live,<br>
Into a far-off nook of heaven there came<br>
A slow miraculous gesture’s dim appeal.<br>
The persistent thrill of a transfiguring touch<br>
Persuaded the inert black quietude<br>
And beauty and wonder disturbed the fields of God.<br>
A wandering hand of pale enchanted light<br>
That glowed along a fading moment’s brink,<br>
Fixed with gold panel and opalescent hinge<br>
A gate of dreams ajar on mystery’s verge.<br>
One lucent corner windowing hidden things<br>
Forced the world’s blind immensity to sight.<br>
The darkness failed and slipped like a falling cloak<br>
From the reclining body of a god.<br>
Then through the pallid rift that seemed at first<br>
Hardly enough for a trickle from the suns,<br>
Outpoured the revelation and the flame.<br>
The brief perpetual sign recurred above.<br>
A glamour from unreached transcendences<br>
Iridescent with the glory of the Unseen,<br>
<br>

BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
A message from the unknown immortal Light<br>
Ablaze upon creation’s quivering edge,<br>
Dawn built her aura of magnificent hues<br>
And buried its seed of grandeur in the hours.<br>
An instant’s visitor the godhead shone.<br>
On life’s thin border awhile the Vision stood<br>
And bent over earth’s pondering forehead curve.<br>
Interpreting a recondite beauty and bliss<br>
In colour’s hieroglyphs of mystic sense,<br>
It wrote the lines of a significant myth<br>
Telling of a greatness of spiritual dawns,<br>
A brilliant code penned with the sky for page.<br>
Almost that day the epiphany was disclosed<br>
Of which our thoughts and hopes are signal flares;<br>
A lonely splendour from the invisible goal<br>
Almost was flung on the opaque Inane.<br>
Once more a tread perturbed the vacant Vasts;<br>
Infinity’s centre, a Face of rapturous calm<br>
Parted the eternal lids that open heaven;<br>
A Form from far beatitudes seemed to near.<br>
Ambassadress twixt eternity and change,<br>
The omniscient Goddess leaned across the breadths<br>
That wrap the fated journeyings of the stars<br>
And saw the spaces ready for her feet.<br>
Once she half looked behind for her veiled sun,<br>
Then, thoughtful, went to her immortal work.<br>
Earth felt the Imperishable’s passage close:<br>
The waking ear of Nature heard her steps<br>
And wideness turned to her its limitless eye,<br>
And, scattered on sealed depths, her luminous smile<br>
Kindled to fire the silence of the worlds.<br>
All grew a consecration and a rite.<br>
Air was a vibrant link between earth and heaven;<br>
The wide-winged hymn of a great priestly wind<br>
Arose and failed upon the altar hills;<br>
The high boughs prayed in a revealing sky.<br>
<br>

CANTO I: The Symbol Dawn<br>
<br>
Here where our half-lit ignorance skirts the gulfs<br>
On the dumb bosom of the ambiguous earth,<br>
Here where one knows not even the step in front<br>
And Truth has her throne on the shadowy back of doubt,<br>
On this anguished and precarious field of toil<br>
Outspread beneath some large indifferent gaze,<br>
Impartial witness of our joy and bale,<br>
Our prostrate soil bore the awakening ray.<br>
Here too the vision and prophetic gleam<br>
Lit into miracles common meaningless shapes;<br>
Then the divine afflatus, spent, withdrew,<br>
Unwanted, fading from the mortal’s range.<br>
A sacred yearning lingered in its trace,<br>
The worship of a Presence and a Power<br>
Too perfect to be held by death-bound hearts,<br>
The prescience of a marvellous birth to come.<br>
Only a little the god-light can stay:<br>
Spiritual beauty illumining human sight<br>
Lines with its passion and mystery Matter’s mask<br>
And squanders eternity on a beat of Time.<br>
As when a soul draws near the sill of birth,<br>
Adjoining mortal time to Timelessness,<br>
A spark of deity lost in Matter’s crypt<br>
Its lustre vanishes in the inconscient planes,<br>
That transitory glow of magic fire<br>
So now dissolved in bright accustomed air.<br>
The message ceased and waned the messenger.<br>
The single Call, the uncompanioned Power,<br>
Drew back into some far-off secret world<br>
The hue and marvel of the supernal beam:<br>
She looked no more on our mortality.<br>
The excess of beauty natural to god-kind<br>
Could not uphold its claim on time-born eyes;<br>
Too mystic-real for space-tenancy<br>
Her body of glory was expunged from heaven:<br>
The rarity and wonder lived no more.<br>
<br>
5<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
There was the common light of earthly day.<br>
Affranchised from the respite of fatigue<br>
Once more the rumour of the speed of Life<br>
Pursued the cycles of her blinded quest.<br>
All sprang to their unvarying daily acts;<br>
The thousand peoples of the soil and tree<br>
Obeyed the unforeseeing instant’s urge,<br>
And, leader here with his uncertain mind,<br>
Alone who stares at the future’s covered face,<br>
Man lifted up the burden of his fate.<br>
And Savitri too awoke among these tribes<br>
That hastened to join the brilliant Summoner’s chant<br>
And, lured by the beauty of the apparent ways,<br>
Acclaimed their portion of ephemeral joy.<br>
Akin to the eternity whence she came,<br>
No part she took in this small happiness;<br>
A mighty stranger in the human field,<br>
The embodied Guest within made no response.<br>
The call that wakes the leap of human mind,<br>
Its chequered eager motion of pursuit,<br>
Its fluttering-hued illusion of desire,<br>
Visited her heart like a sweet alien note.<br>
Time’s message of brief light was not for her.<br>
In her there was the anguish of the gods<br>
Imprisoned in our transient human mould,<br>
The deathless conquered by the death of things.<br>
A vaster Nature’s joy had once been hers,<br>
But long could keep not its gold heavenly hue<br>
Or stand upon this brittle earthly base.<br>
A narrow movement on Time’s deep abysm,<br>
Life’s fragile littleness denied the power,<br>
The proud and conscious wideness and the bliss<br>
She had brought with her into the human form,<br>
The calm delight that weds one soul to all,<br>
The key to the flaming doors of ecstasy.<br>
<br>
6<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Symbol Dawn<br>
<br>
Earth’s grain that needs the sap of pleasure and tears<br>
Rejected the undying rapture’s boon:<br>
Offered to the daughter of infinity<br>
Her passion-flower of love and doom she gave.<br>
In vain now seemed the splendid sacrifice.<br>
A prodigal of her rich divinity,<br>
Her self and all she was she had lent to men,<br>
Hoping her greater being to implant<br>
And in their body’s lives acclimatise<br>
That heaven might native grow on mortal soil.<br>
Hard is it to persuade earth-nature’s change;<br>
Mortality bears ill the eternal’s touch:<br>
It fears the pure divine intolerance<br>
Of that assault of ether and of fire;<br>
It murmurs at its sorrowless happiness,<br>
Almost with hate repels the light it brings;<br>
It trembles at its naked power of Truth<br>
And the might and sweetness of its absolute Voice.<br>
Inflicting on the heights the abysm’s law,<br>
It sullies with its mire heaven’s messengers:<br>
Its thorns of fallen nature are the defence<br>
It turns against the saviour hands of Grace;<br>
It meets the sons of God with death and pain.<br>
A glory of lightnings traversing the earth-scene,<br>
Their sun-thoughts fading, darkened by ignorant minds,<br>
Their work betrayed, their good to evil turned,<br>
The cross their payment for the crown they gave,<br>
Only they leave behind a splendid Name.<br>
A fire has come and touched men’s hearts and gone;<br>
A few have caught flame and risen to greater life.<br>
Too unlike the world she came to help and save,<br>
Her greatness weighed upon its ignorant breast<br>
And from its dim chasms welled a dire return,<br>
A portion of its sorrow, struggle, fall.<br>
To live with grief, to confront death on her road, —<br>
The mortal’s lot became the Immortal’s share.<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
Thus trapped in the gin of earthly destinies,<br>
Awaiting her ordeal’s hour abode,<br>
Outcast from her inborn felicity,<br>
Accepting life’s obscure terrestrial robe,<br>
Hiding herself even from those she loved,<br>
The godhead greater by a human fate.<br>
A dark foreknowledge separated her<br>
From all of whom she was the star and stay;<br>
Too great to impart the peril and the pain,<br>
In her torn depths she kept the grief to come.<br>
As one who watching over men left blind<br>
Takes up the load of an unwitting race,<br>
Harbouring a foe whom with her heart she must feed,<br>
Unknown her act, unknown the doom she faced,<br>
Unhelped she must foresee and dread and dare.<br>
The long-foreknown and fatal morn was here<br>
Bringing a noon that seemed like every noon.<br>
For Nature walks upon her mighty way<br>
Unheeding when she breaks a soul, a life;<br>
Leaving her slain behind she travels on:<br>
Man only marks and God’s all-seeing eyes.<br>
Even in this moment of her soul’s despair,<br>
In its grim rendezvous with death and fear,<br>
No cry broke from her lips, no call for aid;<br>
She told the secret of her woe to none:<br>
Calm was her face and courage kept her mute.<br>
Yet only her outward self suffered and strove;<br>
Even her humanity was half divine:<br>
Her spirit opened to the Spirit in all,<br>
Her nature felt all Nature as its own.<br>
Apart, living within, all lives she bore;<br>
Aloof, she carried in herself the world:<br>
Her dread was one with the great cosmic dread,<br>
Her strength was founded on the cosmic mights;<br>
The universal Mother’s love was hers.<br>
Against the evil at life’s afflicted roots,<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Symbol Dawn<br>
<br>
Her own calamity its private sign,<br>
Of her pangs she made a mystic poignant sword.<br>
A solitary mind, a world-wide heart,<br>
To the lone Immortal’s unshared work she rose.<br>
At first life grieved not in her burdened breast:<br>
On the lap of earth’s original somnolence<br>
Inert, released into forgetfulness,<br>
Prone it reposed, unconscious on mind’s verge,<br>
Obtuse and tranquil like the stone and star.<br>
In a deep cleft of silence twixt two realms<br>
She lay remote from grief, unsawn by care,<br>
Nothing recalling of the sorrow here.<br>
Then a slow faint remembrance shadowlike moved,<br>
And sighing she laid her hand upon her bosom<br>
And recognised the close and lingering ache,<br>
Deep, quiet, old, made natural to its place,<br>
But knew not why it was there nor whence it came.<br>
The Power that kindles mind was still withdrawn:<br>
Heavy, unwilling were life’s servitors<br>
Like workers with no wages of delight;<br>
Sullen, the torch of sense refused to burn;<br>
The unassisted brain found not its past.<br>
Only a vague earth-nature held the frame.<br>
But now she stirred, her life shared the cosmic load.<br>
At the summons of her body’s voiceless call<br>
Her strong far-winging spirit travelled back,<br>
Back to the yoke of ignorance and fate,<br>
Back to the labour and stress of mortal days,<br>
Lighting a pathway through strange symbol dreams<br>
Across the ebbing of the seas of sleep.<br>
Her house of Nature felt an unseen sway,<br>
Illumined swiftly were life’s darkened rooms,<br>
And memory’s casements opened on the hours<br>
And the tired feet of thought approached her doors.<br>
All came back to her: Earth and Love and Doom,<br>
The ancient disputants, encircled her<br>
<br>

<br>
Like giant figures wrestling in the night:<br>
The godheads from the dim Inconscient born<br>
Awoke to struggle and the pang divine,<br>
And in the shadow of her flaming heart,<br>
At the sombre centre of the dire debate,<br>
A guardian of the unconsoled abyss<br>
Inheriting the long agony of the globe,<br>
A stone-still figure of high and godlike Pain<br>
Stared into Space with fixed regardless eyes<br>
That saw grief’s timeless depths but not life’s goal.<br>
Afflicted by his harsh divinity,<br>
Bound to his throne, he waited unappeased<br>
The daily oblation of her unwept tears.<br>
All the fierce question of man’s hours relived.<br>
The sacrifice of suffering and desire<br>
Earth offers to the immortal Ecstasy<br>
Began again beneath the eternal Hand.<br>
Awake she endured the moments’ serried march<br>
And looked on this green smiling dangerous world,<br>
And heard the ignorant cry of living things.<br>
Amid the trivial sounds, the unchanging scene<br>
Her soul arose confronting Time and Fate.<br>
Immobile in herself, she gathered force.<br>
This was the day when Satyavan must die.<br>

The Issue<br>
AWHILE, withdrawn in secret fields of thought,<br>
Her mind moved in a many-imaged past<br>
That lived again and saw its end approach:<br>
Dying, it lived imperishably in her;<br>
Transient and vanishing from transient eyes,<br>
Invisible, a fateful ghost of self,<br>
It bore the future on its phantom breast.<br>
Along the fleeting event’s far-backward trail<br>
Regressed the stream of the insistent hours,<br>
And on the bank of the mysterious flood<br>
Peopled with well-loved forms now seen no more<br>
And the subtle images of things that were,<br>
Her witness spirit stood reviewing Time.<br>
All that she once had hoped and dreamed and been,<br>
Flew past her eagle-winged through memory’s skies.<br>
As in a many-hued flaming inner dawn,<br>
Her life’s broad highways and its sweet bypaths<br>
Lay mapped to her sun-clear recording view,<br>
From the bright country of her childhood’s days<br>
And the blue mountains of her soaring youth<br>
And the paradise groves and peacock wings of Love<br>
To joy clutched under the silent shadow of doom<br>
In a last turn where heaven raced with hell.<br>
Twelve passionate months led in a day of fate.<br>
An absolute supernatural darkness falls<br>
On man sometimes when he draws near to God:<br>
An hour arrives when fail all Nature’s means;<br>
Forced out from the protecting Ignorance<br>
And flung back on his naked primal need,<br>
He at length must cast from him his surface soul<br>
And be the ungarbed entity within:<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
That hour had fallen now on Savitri.<br>
A point she had reached where life must be in vain<br>
Or, in her unborn element awake,<br>
Her will must cancel her body’s destiny.<br>
For only the unborn spirit’s timeless power<br>
Can lift the yoke imposed by birth in Time.<br>
Only the Self that builds this figure of self<br>
Can rase the fixed interminable line<br>
That joins these changing names, these numberless lives,<br>
These new oblivious personalities<br>
And keeps still lurking in our conscious acts<br>
The trail of old forgotten thoughts and deeds,<br>
Disown the legacy of our buried selves,<br>
The burdensome heirship to our vanished forms<br>
Accepted blindly by the body and soul.<br>
An episode in an unremembered tale,<br>
Its beginning lost, its motive and plot concealed,<br>
A once living story has prepared and made<br>
Our present fate, child of past energies.<br>
The fixity of the cosmic sequences<br>
Fastened with hidden inevitable links<br>
She must disrupt, dislodge by her soul’s force<br>
Her past, a block on the Immortal’s road,<br>
Make a rased ground and shape anew her fate.<br>
A colloquy of the original Gods<br>
Meeting upon the borders of the unknown,<br>
Her soul’s debate with embodied Nothingness<br>
Must be wrestled out on a dangerous dim background:<br>
Her being must confront its formless Cause,<br>
Against the universe weigh its single self.<br>
On the bare peak where Self is alone with Nought<br>
And life has no sense and love no place to stand,<br>
She must plead her case upon extinction’s verge,<br>
In the world’s death-cave uphold life’s helpless claim<br>
And vindicate her right to be and love.<br>
Altered must be Nature’s harsh economy;<br>

Acquittance she must win from her past’s bond,<br>
An old account of suffering exhaust,<br>
Strike out from Time the soul’s long compound debt<br>
And the heavy servitudes of the Karmic Gods,<br>
The slow revenge of unforgiving Law<br>
And the deep need of universal pain<br>
And hard sacrifice and tragic consequence.<br>
Out of a timeless barrier she must break,<br>
Penetrate with her thinking depths the Void’s monstrous hush,<br>
Look into the lonely eyes of immortal Death<br>
And with her nude spirit measure the Infinite’s night.<br>
The great and dolorous moment now was close.<br>
A mailed battalion marching to its doom,<br>
The last long days went by with heavy tramp,<br>
Long but too soon to pass, too near the end.<br>
Alone amid the many faces loved,<br>
Aware among unknowing happy hearts,<br>
Her armoured spirit kept watch upon the hours<br>
Listening for a foreseen tremendous step<br>
In the closed beauty of the inhuman wilds.<br>
A combatant in silent dreadful lists,<br>
The world unknowing, for the world she stood:<br>
No helper had she save the Strength within;<br>
There was no witness of terrestrial eyes;<br>
The Gods above and Nature sole below<br>
Were the spectators of that mighty strife.<br>
Around her were the austere sky-pointing hills,<br>
And the green murmurous broad deep-thoughted woods<br>
Muttered incessantly their muffled spell.<br>
A dense magnificent coloured self-wrapped life<br>
Draped in the leaves’ vivid emerald monotone<br>
And set with chequered sunbeams and blithe flowers<br>
Immured her destiny’s secluded scene.<br>
There had she grown to the stature of her spirit:<br>
The genius of titanic silences<br>
Steeping her soul in its wide loneliness<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
Had shown to her her self’s bare reality<br>
And mated her with her environment.<br>
Its solitude greatened her human hours<br>
With a background of the eternal and unique.<br>
A force of spare direct necessity<br>
Reduced the heavy framework of man’s days<br>
And his overburdening mass of outward needs<br>
To a first thin strip of simple animal wants,<br>
And the mighty wildness of the primitive earth<br>
And the brooding multitude of patient trees<br>
And the musing sapphire leisure of the sky<br>
And the solemn weight of the slowly-passing months<br>
Had left in her deep room for thought and God.<br>
There was her drama’s radiant prologue lived.<br>
A spot for the eternal’s tread on earth<br>
Set in the cloistral yearning of the woods<br>
And watched by the aspiration of the peaks<br>
Appeared through an aureate opening in Time,<br>
Where stillness listening felt the unspoken word<br>
And the hours forgot to pass towards grief and change.<br>
Here with the suddenness divine advents have,<br>
Repeating the marvel of the first descent,<br>
Changing to rapture the dull earthly round,<br>
Love came to her hiding the shadow, Death.<br>
Well might he find in her his perfect shrine.<br>
Since first the earth-being’s heavenward growth began,<br>
Through all the long ordeal of the race,<br>
Never a rarer creature bore his shaft,<br>
That burning test of the godhead in our parts,<br>
A lightning from the heights on our abyss.<br>
All in her pointed to a nobler kind.<br>
Near to earth’s wideness, intimate with heaven,<br>
Exalted and swift her young large-visioned spirit<br>
Voyaging through worlds of splendour and of calm<br>
Overflew the ways of Thought to unborn things.<br>
Ardent was her self-poised unstumbling will;<br>

Her mind, a sea of white sincerity,<br>
Passionate in flow, had not one turbid wave.<br>
As in a mystic and dynamic dance<br>
A priestess of immaculate ecstasies<br>
Inspired and ruled from Truth’s revealing vault<br>
Moves in some prophet cavern of the gods,<br>
A heart of silence in the hands of joy<br>
Inhabited with rich creative beats<br>
A body like a parable of dawn<br>
That seemed a niche for veiled divinity<br>
Or golden temple-door to things beyond.<br>
Immortal rhythms swayed in her time-born steps;<br>
Her look, her smile awoke celestial sense<br>
Even in earth-stuff, and their intense delight<br>
Poured a supernal beauty on men’s lives.<br>
A wide self-giving was her native act;<br>
A magnanimity as of sea or sky<br>
Enveloped with its greatness all that came<br>
And gave a sense as of a greatened world:<br>
Her kindly care was a sweet temperate sun,<br>
Her high passion a blue heaven’s equipoise.<br>
As might a soul fly like a hunted bird,<br>
Escaping with tired wings from a world of storms,<br>
And a quiet reach like a remembered breast,<br>
In a haven of safety and splendid soft repose<br>
One could drink life back in streams of honey-fire,<br>
Recover the lost habit of happiness,<br>
Feel her bright nature’s glorious ambience,<br>
And preen joy in her warmth and colour’s rule.<br>
A deep of compassion, a hushed sanctuary,<br>
Her inward help unbarred a gate in heaven;<br>
Love in her was wider than the universe,<br>
The whole world could take refuge in her single heart.<br>
The great unsatisfied godhead here could dwell:<br>
Vacant of the dwarf self’s imprisoned air,<br>
Her mood could harbour his sublimer breath<br>

For even her gulfs were secrecies of light.<br>
At once she was the stillness and the word,<br>
A continent of self-diffusing peace,<br>
An ocean of untrembling virgin fire;<br>
The strength, the silence of the gods were hers.<br>
In her he found a vastness like his own,<br>
His high warm subtle ether he refound<br>
And moved in her as in his natural home.<br>
In her he met his own eternity.<br>
Till then no mournful line had barred this ray.<br>
On the frail breast of this precarious earth,<br>
Since her orbed sight in its breath-fastened house,<br>
Opening in sympathy with happier stars<br>
Where life is not exposed to sorrowful change,<br>
Remembered beauty death-claimed lids ignore<br>
And wondered at this world of fragile forms<br>
Carried on canvas-strips of shimmering Time,<br>
The impunity of unborn Mights was hers.<br>
Although she leaned to bear the human load,<br>
Her walk kept still the measures of the gods.<br>
Earth’s breath had failed to stain that brilliant glass:<br>
Unsmeared with the dust of our mortal atmosphere<br>
It still reflected heaven’s spiritual joy.<br>
Almost they saw who lived within her light<br>
Her playmate in the sempiternal spheres<br>
Descended from its unattainable realms<br>
In her attracting advent’s luminous wake,<br>
The white-fire dragon-bird of endless bliss<br>
Drifting with burning wings above her days:<br>
Heaven’s tranquil shield guarded the missioned child.<br>
A glowing orbit was her early term,<br>

There is a darkness in terrestrial things<br>
That will not suffer long too glad a note.<br>
On her too closed the inescapable Hand:<br>
The armed Immortal bore the snare of Time.<br>
One dealt with her who meets the burdened great.<br>
Assigner of the ordeal and the path<br>
Who chooses in this holocaust of the soul<br>
Death, fall and sorrow as the spirit’s goads,<br>
The dubious godhead with his torch of pain<br>
Lit up the chasm of the unfinished world<br>
And called her to fill with her vast self the abyss.<br>
August and pitiless in his calm outlook,<br>
Heightening the Eternal’s dreadful strategy,<br>
He measured the difficulty with the might<br>
And dug more deep the gulf that all must cross.<br>
Assailing her divinest elements,<br>
He made her heart kin to the striving human heart<br>
And forced her strength to its appointed road.<br>
For this she had accepted mortal breath;<br>
To wrestle with the Shadow she had come<br>
And must confront the riddle of man’s birth<br>
And life’s brief struggle in dumb Matter’s night.<br>
Whether to bear with Ignorance and death<br>
Or hew the ways of Immortality,<br>
To win or lose the godlike game for man,<br>
Was her soul’s issue thrown with Destiny’s dice.<br>
But not to submit and suffer was she born;<br>
To lead, to deliver was her glorious part.<br>
Here was no fabric of terrestrial make<br>
Fit for a day’s use by busy careless Powers.<br>
An image fluttering on the screen of Fate,<br>
Half-animated for a passing show,<br>
Or a castaway on the ocean of Desire<br>
Flung to the eddies in a ruthless sport<br>
And tossed along the gulfs of Circumstance,<br>
A creature born to bend beneath the yoke,<br>

Or one more pawn who comes destined to be pushed<br>
One slow move forward on a measureless board<br>
In the chess-play of the earth-soul with Doom, —<br>
Such is the human figure drawn by Time.<br>
A conscious frame was here, a self-born Force.<br>
In this enigma of the dusk of God,<br>
This slow and strange uneasy compromise<br>
Of limiting Nature with a limitless Soul,<br>
Where all must move between an ordered Chance<br>
And an uncaring blind Necessity,<br>
Too high the fire spiritual dare not blaze.<br>
If once it met the intense original Flame,<br>
An answering touch might shatter all measures made<br>
And earth sink down with the weight of the Infinite.<br>
A gaol is this immense material world:<br>
Across each road stands armed a stone-eyed Law,<br>
At every gate the huge dim sentinels pace.<br>
A grey tribunal of the Ignorance,<br>
An Inquisition of the priests of Night<br>
In judgment sit on the adventurer soul,<br>
And the dual tables and the Karmic norm<br>
Restrain the Titan in us and the God:<br>
Pain with its lash, joy with its silver bribe<br>
Guard the Wheel’s circling immobility.<br>
A bond is put on the high-climbing mind,<br>
A seal on the too large wide-open heart;<br>
Death stays the journeying discoverer, Life.<br>
Thus is the throne of the Inconscient safe<br>
While the tardy coilings of the aeons pass<br>
And the Animal browses in the sacred fence<br>
And the gold Hawk can cross the skies no more.<br>
But one stood up and lit the limitless flame.<br>
Arraigned by the dark Power that hates all bliss<br>
In the dire court where life must pay for joy,<br>
Sentenced by the mechanic justicer<br>

Admitting without appeal the nether gods.<br>
In her the superhuman cast its seed.<br>
Inapt to fold its mighty wings of dream<br>
Her spirit refused to hug the common soil,<br>
Or, finding all life’s golden meanings robbed,<br>
Compound with earth, struck from the starry list,<br>
Or quench with black despair the God-given light.<br>
Accustomed to the eternal and the true,<br>
Her being conscious of its divine founts<br>
Asked not from mortal frailty pain’s relief,<br>
Patched not with failure bargain or compromise.<br>
A work she had to do, a word to speak:<br>
Writing the unfinished story of her soul<br>
In thoughts and actions graved in Nature’s book,<br>
She accepted not to close the luminous page,<br>
Cancel her commerce with eternity,<br>
Or set a signature of weak assent<br>
To the brute balance of the world’s exchange.<br>

Pursuing after death immortal aims,<br>
Repugned to admit frustration’s barren role,<br>
Forfeit the meaning of her birth in Time,<br>

Or yield her high destiny up to passing Chance.<br>
In her own self she found her high recourse;<br>
She matched with the iron law her sovereign right:<br>

And bore a kinship’s weight, a common tie,<br>
Yet stood untouched, king of itself, alone.<br>
A magical accord quickened and attuned<br>
To ethereal symphonies the old earthy strings;<br>
It raised the servitors of mind and life<br>
To be happy partners in the soul’s response,<br>
Tissue and nerve were turned to sensitive chords,<br>
Records of lustre and ecstasy; it made<br>
The body’s means the spirit’s acolytes.<br>
A heavenlier function with a finer mode<br>
Lit with its grace man’s outward earthliness;<br>
The soul’s experience of its deeper sheaths<br>
No more slept drugged by Matter’s dominance.<br>
In the dead wall closing us from wider self,<br>
Into a secrecy of apparent sleep,<br>
The mystic tract beyond our waking thoughts,<br>
A door parted, built in by Matter’s force,<br>
Releasing things unseized by earthly sense:<br>
A world unseen, unknown by outward mind<br>
Appeared in the silent spaces of the soul.<br>
He sat in secret chambers looking out<br>
Into the luminous countries of the unborn<br>
Where all things dreamed by the mind are seen and true<br>
And all that the life longs for is drawn close.<br>
He saw the Perfect in their starry homes<br>
Wearing the glory of a deathless form,<br>
<br>

<br>
Lain in the arms of the Eternal’s peace,<br>
Rapt in the heart-beats of God-ecstasy.<br>
He lived in the mystic space where thought is born<br>
And will is nursed by an ethereal Power<br>
And fed on the white milk of the Eternal’s strengths<br>
Till it grows into the likeness of a god.<br>
In the Witness’s occult rooms with mind-built walls<br>
On hidden interiors, lurking passages<br>
Opened the windows of the inner sight.<br>
He owned the house of undivided Time.<br>
Lifting the heavy curtain of the flesh<br>
He stood upon a threshold serpent-watched,<br>
And peered into gleaming endless corridors,<br>
Silent and listening in the silent heart<br>
For the coming of the new and the unknown.<br>
He gazed across the empty stillnesses<br>
And heard the footsteps of the undreamed Idea<br>
In the far avenues of the Beyond.<br>
He heard the secret Voice, the Word that knows,<br>
And saw the secret face that is our own.<br>
The inner planes uncovered their crystal doors;<br>
Strange powers and influences touched his life.<br>
A vision came of higher realms than ours,<br>
A consciousness of brighter fields and skies,<br>
Of beings less circumscribed than brief-lived men<br>
And subtler bodies than these passing frames,<br>
Objects too fine for our material grasp,<br>
Acts vibrant with a superhuman light<br>
And movements pushed by a superconscient force,<br>
And joys that never flowed through mortal limbs,<br>
And lovelier scenes than earth’s and happier lives.<br>
A consciousness of beauty and of bliss,<br>
A knowledge which became what it perceived,<br>
Replaced the separated sense and heart<br>
And drew all Nature into its embrace.<br>
The mind leaned out to meet the hidden worlds:<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Yoga of the Soul’s Release<br>
<br>
Air glowed and teemed with marvellous shapes and hues,<br>
In the nostrils quivered celestial fragrances,<br>
On the tongue lingered the honey of paradise.<br>
A channel of universal harmony,<br>
Hearing was a stream of magic audience,<br>
A bed for occult sounds earth cannot hear.<br>
Out of a covert tract of slumber self<br>
The voice came of a truth submerged, unknown<br>
That flows beneath the cosmic surfaces,<br>
Only mid an omniscient silence heard,<br>
Held by intuitive heart and secret sense.<br>
It caught the burden of secrecies sealed and dumb,<br>
It voiced the unfulfilled demand of earth<br>
And the song of promise of unrealised heavens<br>
And all that hides in an omnipotent Sleep.<br>
In the unceasing drama carried by Time<br>
On its long listening flood that bears the world’s<br>
Insoluble doubt on a pilgrimage without goal,<br>
A laughter of sleepless pleasure foamed and spumed<br>
And murmurings of desire that cannot die:<br>
A cry came of the world’s delight to be,<br>
The grandeur and greatness of its will to live,<br>
Recall of the soul’s adventure into space,<br>
A traveller through the magic centuries<br>
And being’s labour in Matter’s universe,<br>
Its search for the mystic meaning of its birth<br>
And joy of high spiritual response,<br>
Its throb of satisfaction and content<br>
In all the sweetness of the gifts of life,<br>
Its large breath and pulse and thrill of hope and fear,<br>
Its taste of pangs and tears and ecstasy,<br>
Its rapture’s poignant beat of sudden bliss,<br>
The sob of its passion and unending pain.<br>
The murmur and whisper of the unheard sounds<br>
Which crowd around our hearts but find no window<br>
To enter, swelled into a canticle<br>
<br>
29<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
Of all that suffers to be still unknown<br>
And all that labours vainly to be born<br>
And all the sweetness none will ever taste<br>
And all the beauty that will never be.<br>
Inaudible to our deaf mortal ears<br>
The wide world-rhythms wove their stupendous chant<br>
To which life strives to fit our rhyme-beats here,<br>
Melting our limits in the illimitable,<br>
Tuning the finite to infinity.<br>
A low muttering rose from the subconscient caves,<br>
The stammer of the primal ignorance;<br>
Answer to that inarticulate questioning,<br>
There stooped with lightning neck and thunder’s wings<br>
A radiant hymn to the Inexpressible<br>
And the anthem of the superconscient light.<br>
All was revealed there none can here express;<br>
Vision and dream were fables spoken by truth<br>
Or symbols more veridical than fact,<br>
Or were truths enforced by supernatural seals.<br>
Immortal eyes approached and looked in his,<br>
And beings of many kingdoms neared and spoke:<br>
The ever-living whom we name as dead<br>
Could leave their glory beyond death and birth<br>
To utter the wisdom which exceeds all phrase:<br>
The kings of evil and the kings of good,<br>
Appellants at the reason’s judgment seat,<br>
Proclaimed the gospel of their opposites,<br>
And all believed themselves spokesmen of God:<br>
The gods of light and titans of the dark<br>
Battled for his soul as for a costly prize.<br>
In every hour loosed from the quiver of Time<br>
There rose a song of new discovery,<br>
A bow-twang’s hum of young experiment.<br>
Each day was a spiritual romance,<br>
As if he was born into a bright new world;<br>
Adventure leaped an unexpected friend,<br>
<br>
30<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Yoga of the Soul’s Release<br>
<br>
And danger brought a keen sweet tang of joy;<br>
Each happening was a deep experience.<br>
There were high encounters, epic colloquies,<br>
And counsels came couched in celestial speech,<br>
And honeyed pleadings breathed from occult lips<br>
To help the heart to yield to rapture’s call,<br>
And sweet temptations stole from beauty’s realms<br>
And sudden ecstasies from a world of bliss.<br>
It was a region of wonder and delight.<br>
All now his bright clairaudience could receive;<br>
A contact thrilled of mighty unknown things.<br>
Awakened to new unearthly closenesses,<br>
The touch replied to subtle infinities,<br>
And with a silver cry of opening gates<br>
Sight’s lightnings leaped into the invisible.<br>
Ever his consciousness and vision grew;<br>
They took an ampler sweep, a loftier flight;<br>
He passed the border marked for Matter’s rule<br>
And passed the zone where thought replaces life.<br>
Out of this world of signs suddenly he came<br>
Into a silent self where world was not<br>
And looked beyond into a nameless vast.<br>
These symbol figures lost their right to live,<br>
All tokens dropped our sense can recognise;<br>
There the heart beat no more at body’s touch,<br>
There the eyes gazed no more on beauty’s shape.<br>
In rare and lucent intervals of hush<br>
Into a signless region he could soar<br>
Packed with the deep contents of formlessness<br>
Where world was into a single being rapt<br>
And all was known by the light of identity<br>
And Spirit was its own self-evidence.<br>
The Supreme’s gaze looked out through human eyes<br>
And saw all things and creatures as itself<br>
And knew all thought and word as its own voice.<br>
There unity is too close for search and clasp<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
And love is a yearning of the One for the One,<br>
And beauty is a sweet difference of the Same<br>
And oneness is the soul of multitude.<br>
There all the truths unite in a single Truth,<br>
And all ideas rejoin Reality.<br>
There knowing herself by her own termless self,<br>
Wisdom supernal, wordless, absolute<br>
Sat uncompanioned in the eternal Calm,<br>
All-seeing, motionless, sovereign and alone.<br>
There knowledge needs not words to embody Idea;<br>
Idea, seeking a house in boundlessness,<br>
Weary of its homeless immortality,<br>
Asks not in thought’s carved brilliant cell to rest<br>
Whose single window’s clipped outlook on things<br>
Sees only a little arc of God’s vast sky.<br>
The boundless with the boundless there consorts;<br>
While there, one can be wider than the world;<br>
While there, one is one’s own infinity.<br>
His centre was no more in earthly mind;<br>
A power of seeing silence filled his limbs:<br>
Caught by a voiceless white epiphany<br>
Into a vision that surpasses forms,<br>
Into a living that surpasses life,<br>
He neared the still consciousness sustaining all.<br>
The voice that only by speech can move the mind<br>
Became a silent knowledge in the soul;<br>
The strength that only in action feels its truth<br>
Was lodged now in a mute omnipotent peace.<br>
A leisure in the labour of the worlds,<br>
A pause in the joy and anguish of the search<br>
Restored the stress of Nature to God’s calm.<br>
A vast unanimity ended life’s debate.<br>
The war of thoughts that fathers the universe,<br>
The clash of forces struggling to prevail<br>
In the tremendous shock that lights a star<br>
As in the building of a grain of dust,<br>
<br>
32<br>

CANTO III: The Yoga of the Soul’s Release<br>

The grooves that turn their dumb ellipse in space<br>
Ploughed by the seeking of the world’s desire,<br>
The long regurgitations of Time’s flood,<br>
The torment edging the dire force of lust<br>
That wakes kinetic in earth’s dullard slime<br>
And carves a personality out of mud,<br>
The sorrow by which Nature’s hunger is fed,<br>
The oestrus which creates with fire of pain,<br>
The fate that punishes virtue with defeat,<br>
The tragedy that destroys long happiness,<br>
The weeping of Love, the quarrel of the Gods,<br>
Ceased in a truth which lives in its own light.<br>
His soul stood free, a witness and a king.<br>
Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux<br>
Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft<br>
Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon,<br>
He abode at rest in indivisible Time.<br>
As if a story long written but acted now,<br>
In his present he held his future and his past,<br>
Felt in the seconds the uncounted years<br>
And saw the hours like dots upon a page.<br>
An aspect of the unknown Reality<br>
Altered the meaning of the cosmic scene.<br>
This huge material universe became<br>
A small result of a stupendous force:<br>
Overtaking the moment the eternal Ray<br>
Illumined That which never yet was made.<br>
Thought lay down in a mighty voicelessness;<br>
The toiling Thinker widened and grew still,<br>
Wisdom transcendent touched his quivering heart:<br>
His soul could sail beyond thought’s luminous bar;<br>
Mind screened no more the shoreless infinite.<br>
Across a void retreating sky he glimpsed<br>
Through a last glimmer and drift of vanishing stars<br>
The superconscient realms of motionless Peace<br>
Where judgment ceases and the word is mute<br>
<br>
33<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
And the Unconceived lies pathless and alone.<br>
There came not form or any mounting voice;<br>
There only were Silence and the Absolute.<br>
Out of that stillness mind new-born arose<br>
And woke to truths once inexpressible,<br>
And forms appeared, dumbly significant,<br>
A seeing thought, a self-revealing voice.<br>
He knew the source from which his spirit came:<br>
Movement was married to the immobile Vast;<br>
He plunged his roots into the Infinite,<br>
He based his life upon eternity.<br>
Only awhile at first these heavenlier states,<br>
These large wide-poised upliftings could endure.<br>
The high and luminous tension breaks too soon,<br>
The body’s stone stillness and the life’s hushed trance,<br>
The breathless might and calm of silent mind;<br>
Or slowly they fail as sets a golden day.<br>
The restless nether members tire of peace;<br>
A nostalgia of old little works and joys,<br>
A need to call back small familiar selves,<br>
To tread the accustomed and inferior way,<br>
The need to rest in a natural pose of fall,<br>
As a child who learns to walk can walk not long,<br>
Replace the titan will for ever to climb,<br>
On the heart’s altar dim the sacred fire.<br>
An old pull of subconscious cords renews;<br>
It draws the unwilling spirit from the heights,<br>
Or a dull gravitation drags us down<br>
To the blind driven inertia of our base.<br>
This too the supreme Diplomat can use,<br>
He makes our fall a means for greater rise.<br>
For into ignorant Nature’s gusty field,<br>
Into the half-ordered chaos of mortal life<br>
The formless Power, the Self of eternal light<br>
Follow in the shadow of the spirit’s descent;<br>
<br>
34<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Yoga of the Soul’s Release<br>

The twin duality for ever one<br>
Chooses its home mid the tumults of the sense.<br>
He comes unseen into our darker parts<br>
And, curtained by the darkness, does his work,<br>
A subtle and all-knowing guest and guide,<br>
Till they too feel the need and will to change.<br>
All here must learn to obey a higher law,<br>
Our body’s cells must hold the Immortal’s flame.<br>
Else would the spirit reach alone its source<br>
Leaving a half-saved world to its dubious fate.<br>
Nature would ever labour unredeemed;<br>
Our earth would ever spin unhelped in Space,<br>
And this immense creation’s purpose fail<br>
Till at last the frustrate universe sank undone.<br>
Even his godlike strength to rise must fall:<br>
His greater consciousness withdrew behind;<br>
Dim and eclipsed, his human outside strove<br>
To feel again the old sublimities,<br>
Bring the high saving touch, the ethereal flame,<br>
Call back to its dire need the divine Force.<br>
Always the power poured back like sudden rain,<br>
Or slowly in his breast a presence grew;<br>
It clambered back to some remembered height<br>
Or soared above the peak from which it fell.<br>
Each time he rose there was a larger poise,<br>
A dwelling on a higher spirit plane;<br>
The Light remained in him a longer space.<br>
In this oscillation between earth and heaven,<br>
In this ineffable communion’s climb<br>
There grew in him as grows a waxing moon<br>
The glory of the integer of his soul.<br>
A union of the Real with the unique,<br>
A gaze of the Alone from every face,<br>
The presence of the Eternal in the hours<br>
Widening the mortal mind’s half-look on things,<br>
Bridging the gap between man’s force and Fate<br>
<br>
35<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
Made whole the fragment-being we are here.<br>
At last was won a firm spiritual poise,<br>
A constant lodging in the Eternal’s realm,<br>
A safety in the Silence and the Ray,<br>
A settlement in the Immutable.<br>
His heights of being lived in the still Self;<br>
His mind could rest on a supernal ground<br>
And look down on the magic and the play<br>
Where the God-child lies on the lap of Night and Dawn<br>
And the Everlasting puts on Time’s disguise.<br>
To the still heights and to the troubled depths<br>
His equal spirit gave its vast assent:<br>
A poised serenity of tranquil strength,<br>
A wide unshaken look on Time’s unrest<br>
Faced all experience with unaltered peace.<br>
Indifferent to the sorrow and delight,<br>
Untempted by the marvel and the call,<br>
Immobile it beheld the flux of things,<br>
Calm and apart supported all that is:<br>
His spirit’s stillness helped the toiling world.<br>
Inspired by silence and the closed eyes’ sight<br>
His force could work with a new luminous art<br>
On the crude material from which all is made<br>
And the refusal of Inertia’s mass<br>
And the grey front of the world’s Ignorance<br>
And nescient Matter and the huge error of life.<br>
As a sculptor chisels a deity out of stone<br>
He slowly chipped off the dark envelope,<br>
Line of defence of Nature’s ignorance,<br>
The illusion and mystery of the Inconscient<br>
In whose black pall the Eternal wraps his head<br>
That he may act unknown in cosmic Time.<br>
A splendour of self-creation from the peaks,<br>
A transfiguration in the mystic depths,<br>
A happier cosmic working could begin<br>
And fashion the world-shape in him anew,<br>

God found in Nature, Nature fulfilled in God.<br>
Already in him was seen that task of Power:<br>
Life made its home on the high tops of self;<br>
His soul, mind, heart became a single sun;<br>
Only life’s lower reaches remained dim.<br>
But there too, in the uncertain shadow of life,<br>
There was a labour and a fiery breath;<br>
The ambiguous cowled celestial puissance worked<br>
Watched by the inner Witness’s moveless peace.<br>
Even on the struggling Nature left below<br>
Strong periods of illumination came:<br>
Lightnings of glory after glory burned,<br>
Experience was a tale of blaze and fire,<br>
Air rippled round the argosies of the Gods,<br>
Strange riches sailed to him from the Unseen;<br>
Splendours of insight filled the blank of thought,<br>
Knowledge spoke to the inconscient stillnesses,<br>
Rivers poured down of bliss and luminous force,<br>
Visits of beauty, storm-sweeps of delight<br>
Rained from the all-powerful Mystery above.<br>
Thence stooped the eagles of Omniscience.<br>
A dense veil was rent, a mighty whisper heard;<br>
Repeated in the privacy of his soul,<br>
A wisdom-cry from rapt transcendences<br>
Sang on the mountains of an unseen world;<br>
The voices that an inner listening hears<br>
Conveyed to him their prophet utterances,<br>
And flame-wrapped outbursts of the immortal Word<br>
And flashes of an occult revealing Light<br>
Approached him from the unreachable Secrecy.<br>
An inspired Knowledge sat enthroned within<br>
Whose seconds illumined more than reason’s years:<br>
An ictus of revealing lustre fell<br>
As if a pointing accent upon Truth,<br>
And like a sky-flare showing all the ground<br>
A swift intuitive discernment shone.<br>

One glance could separate the true and false,<br>
Or raise its rapid torch-fire in the dark<br>
To check the claimants crowding through mind’s gates<br>
Covered by the forged signatures of the gods,<br>
Detect the magic bride in her disguise<br>
Or scan the apparent face of thought and life.<br>
Oft inspiration with her lightning feet,<br>
A sudden messenger from the all-seeing tops,<br>
Traversed the soundless corridors of his mind<br>
Bringing her rhythmic sense of hidden things.<br>
A music spoke transcending mortal speech.<br>
As if from a golden phial of the All-Bliss,<br>
A joy of light, a joy of sudden sight,<br>
A rapture of the thrilled undying Word<br>
Poured into his heart as into an empty cup,<br>
A repetition of God’s first delight<br>
Creating in a young and virgin Time.<br>
In a brief moment caught, a little space,<br>
All-Knowledge packed into great wordless thoughts<br>
Lodged in the expectant stillness of his depths<br>
A crystal of the ultimate Absolute,<br>
A portion of the inexpressible Truth<br>
Revealed by silence to the silent soul.<br>

Her power fallen speechless grew more intimate;<br>
She looked upon the seen and the unforeseen,<br>
Unguessed domains she made her native field.<br>

As when the eyes stare at an invisible point<br>
Till through the intensity of one luminous spot<br>
An apocalypse of a world of images<br>
Enters into the kingdom of the seer.<br>

An eye awake in voiceless heights of trance,<br>
A mind plucking at the unimaginable,<br>
Overleaping with a sole and perilous bound<br>
The high black wall hiding superconscience,<br>
She broke in with inspired speech for scythe<br>
And plundered the Unknowable’s vast estate.<br>
A gleaner of infinitesimal grains of Truth,<br>
A sheaf-binder of infinite experience,<br>
She pierced the guarded mysteries of World-Force<br>
And her magic methods wrapped in a thousand veils;<br>
Or she gathered the lost secrets dropped by Time<br>
In the dust and crannies of his mounting route<br>
Mid old forsaken dreams of hastening Mind<br>
And buried remnants of forgotten space.<br>
A traveller between summit and abyss,<br>
She joined the distant ends, the viewless deeps,<br>
Or streaked along the roads of Heaven and Hell<br>
Pursuing all knowledge like a questing hound.<br>
A reporter and scribe of hidden wisdom talk,<br>
Her shining minutes of celestial speech,<br>
Passed through the masked office of the occult mind,<br>
Transmitting gave to prophet and to seer<br>
The inspired body of the mystic Truth.<br>
A recorder of the inquiry of the gods,<br>
Spokesman of the silent seeings of the Supreme,<br>
She brought immortal words to mortal men.<br>
Above the reason’s brilliant slender curve,<br>
Released like radiant air dimming a moon,<br>
Broad spaces of a vision without line<br>

Ran like dream-smiles through meditating vasts:<br>
Disclosed stood up in a gold moment’s blaze<br>
White sun-steppes in the pathless Infinite.<br>
Along a naked curve in bourneless Self<br>
The points that run through the closed heart of things<br>
Shadowed the indeterminable line<br>
That carries the Everlasting through the years.<br>
The magician order of the cosmic Mind<br>
Coercing the freedom of infinity<br>
With the stark array of Nature’s symbol facts<br>
And life’s incessant signals of event,<br>
Transmuted chance recurrences into laws,<br>
A chaos of signs into a universe.<br>
Out of the rich wonders and the intricate whorls<br>
Of the spirit’s dance with Matter as its mask<br>
The balance of the world’s design grew clear,<br>
Its symmetry of self-arranged effects<br>
Managed in the deep perspectives of the soul,<br>
And the realism of its illusive art,<br>
Its logic of infinite intelligence,<br>
Its magic of a changing eternity.<br>
A glimpse was caught of things for ever unknown:<br>
The letters stood out of the unmoving Word:<br>
In the immutable nameless Origin<br>
Was seen emerging as from fathomless seas<br>
The trail of the Ideas that made the world,<br>
And, sown in the black earth of Nature’s trance,<br>
The seed of the Spirit’s blind and huge desire<br>
From which the tree of cosmos was conceived<br>
And spread its magic arms through a dream of space.<br>
Immense realities took on a shape:<br>
There looked out from the shadow of the Unknown<br>

Peered out; he saw the hope that never sleeps,<br>
The feet that run behind a fleeting fate,<br>
The ineffable meaning of the endless dream.<br>
Hardly for a moment glimpsed viewless to Mind,<br>
As if a torch held by a power of God,<br>
The radiant world of the everlasting Truth<br>
Glimmered like a faint star bordering the night<br>
Above the golden Overmind’s shimmering ridge.<br>
Even were caught as through a cunning veil<br>
The smile of love that sanctions the long game,<br>
The calm indulgence and maternal breasts<br>
Of Wisdom suckling the child-laughter of Chance,<br>

Lifted, it showed the riches of the Cave<br>
Where, by the miser traffickers of sense<br>
Unused, guarded beneath Night’s dragon paws,<br>
In folds of velvet darkness draped they sleep<br>
Whose priceless value could have saved the world.<br>
A darkness carrying morning in its breast<br>
Looked for the eternal wide returning gleam,<br>
Waiting the advent of a larger ray<br>
And rescue of the lost herds of the Sun.<br>
In a splendid extravagance of the waste of God<br>
Dropped carelessly in creation’s spendthrift work,<br>
Left in the chantiers of the bottomless world<br>
And stolen by the robbers of the Deep,<br>
The golden shekels of the Eternal lie,<br>
Hoarded from touch and view and thought’s desire,<br>
Locked in blind antres of the ignorant flood,<br>
Lest men should find them and be even as Gods.<br>
A vision lightened on the viewless heights,<br>
A wisdom illumined from the voiceless depths:<br>
A deeper interpretation greatened Truth,<br>
A grand reversal of the Night and Day;<br>
All the world’s values changed heightening life’s aim;<br>
A wiser word, a larger thought came in<br>

<br>
Seeking its own perfect form in souls and things.<br>
Life kept no more a dull and meaningless shape.<br>
In the struggle and upheaval of the world<br>
He saw the labour of a godhead’s birth.<br>
A secret knowledge masked as Ignorance;<br>
Fate covered with an unseen necessity<br>
The game of chance of an omnipotent Will.<br>
A glory and a rapture and a charm,<br>
The All-Blissful sat unknown within the heart;<br>
Earth’s pains were the ransom of its prisoned delight.<br>
A glad communion tinged the passing hours;<br>
The days were travellers on a destined road,<br>
The nights companions of his musing spirit.<br>
A heavenly impetus quickened all his breast;<br>
The trudge of Time changed to a splendid march;<br>
The divine Dwarf towered to unconquered worlds,<br>
Earth grew too narrow for his victory.<br>
Once only registering the heavy tread<br>
Of a blind Power on human littleness,<br>
Life now became a sure approach to God,<br>
Existence a divine experiment<br>
And cosmos the soul’s opportunity.<br>
The world was a conception and a birth<br>
Of Spirit in Matter into living forms,<br>
And Nature bore the Immortal in her womb,<br>
That she might climb through him to eternal life.<br>
His being lay down in bright immobile peace<br>
And bathed in wells of pure spiritual light;<br>
It wandered in wide fields of wisdom-self<br>
Lit by the rays of an everlasting sun.<br>
Even his body’s subtle self within<br>
Could raise the earthly parts towards higher things<br>
And feel on it the breath of heavenlier air.<br>
Already it journeyed towards divinity:<br>
Upbuoyed upon winged winds of rapid joy,<br>
Upheld to a Light it could not always hold,<br>
<br>

BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
It left mind’s distance from the Truth supreme<br>
And lost life’s incapacity for bliss.<br>
All now suppressed in us began to emerge.<br>
Thus came his soul’s release from Ignorance,<br>
His mind and body’s first spiritual change.<br>
A wide God-knowledge poured down from above,<br>
A new world-knowledge broadened from within:<br>
His daily thoughts looked up to the True and One,<br>
His commonest doings welled from an inner Light.<br>
Awakened to the lines that Nature hides,<br>
Attuned to her movements that exceed our ken,<br>
He grew one with a covert universe.<br>
His grasp surprised her mightiest energies’ springs;<br>
He spoke with the unknown Guardians of the worlds,<br>
Forms he descried our mortal eyes see not.<br>
His wide eyes bodied viewless entities,<br>
He saw the cosmic forces at their work<br>
And felt the occult impulse behind man’s will.<br>
Time’s secrets were to him an oft-read book;<br>
The records of the future and the past<br>
Outlined their excerpts on the etheric page.<br>
One and harmonious by the Maker’s skill,<br>
The human in him paced with the divine;<br>
His acts betrayed not the interior flame.<br>
This forged the greatness of his front to earth.<br>
A genius heightened in his body’s cells<br>
That knew the meaning of his fate-hedged works<br>
Akin to the march of unaccomplished Powers<br>
Beyond life’s arc in spirit’s immensities.<br>
Apart he lived in his mind’s solitude,<br>
A demigod shaping the lives of men:<br>
One soul’s ambition lifted up the race;<br>
A Power worked, but none knew whence it came.<br>
The universal strengths were linked with his;<br>
Filling earth’s smallness with their boundless breadths,<br>
<br>
44<br>

He drew the energies that transmute an age.<br>
Immeasurable by the common look,<br>
He made great dreams a mould for coming things<br>
And cast his deeds like bronze to front the years.<br>
His walk through Time outstripped the human stride.<br>
Lonely his days and splendid like the sun’s.<br>

The Secret Knowledge<br>
ON A height he stood that looked towards greater heights.<br>
Our early approaches to the Infinite<br>
Are sunrise splendours on a marvellous verge<br>
While lingers yet unseen the glorious sun.<br>
What now we see is a shadow of what must come.<br>
The earth’s uplook to a remote Unknown<br>
Is a preface only of the epic climb<br>
Of human soul from its flat earthly state<br>
To the discovery of a greater self<br>
And the far gleam of an eternal Light.<br>
This world is a beginning and a base<br>
Where Life and Mind erect their structured dreams;<br>
An unborn Power must build reality.<br>
A deathbound littleness is not all we are:<br>
Immortal our forgotten vastnesses<br>
Await discovery in our summit selves;<br>
Unmeasured breadths and depths of being are ours.<br>
Akin to the ineffable Secrecy,<br>
Mystic, eternal in unrealised Time,<br>
Neighbours of Heaven are Nature’s altitudes.<br>
To these high-peaked dominions sealed to our search,<br>
Too far from surface Nature’s postal routes,<br>
Too lofty for our mortal lives to breathe,<br>
Deep in us a forgotten kinship points<br>
And a faint voice of ecstasy and prayer<br>
Calls to those lucent lost immensities.<br>
Even when we fail to look into our souls<br>
Or lie embedded in earthly consciousness,<br>
Still have we parts that grow towards the light,<br>
Yet are there luminous tracts and heavens serene<br>
And Eldorados of splendour and ecstasy<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Secret Knowledge<br>
<br>
And temples to the godhead none can see.<br>
A shapeless memory lingers in us still<br>
And sometimes, when our sight is turned within,<br>
Earth’s ignorant veil is lifted from our eyes;<br>
There is a short miraculous escape.<br>
This narrow fringe of clamped experience<br>
We leave behind meted to us as life,<br>
Our little walks, our insufficient reach.<br>
Our souls can visit in great lonely hours<br>
Still regions of imperishable Light,<br>
All-seeing eagle-peaks of silent Power<br>
And moon-flame oceans of swift fathomless Bliss<br>
And calm immensities of spirit space.<br>
In the unfolding process of the Self<br>
Sometimes the inexpressible Mystery<br>
Elects a human vessel of descent.<br>
A breath comes down from a supernal air,<br>
A Presence is born, a guiding Light awakes,<br>
A stillness falls upon the instruments:<br>
Fixed, motionless like a marble monument,<br>
Stone-calm, the body is a pedestal<br>
Supporting a figure of eternal Peace.<br>
Or a revealing Force sweeps blazing in;<br>
Out of some vast superior continent<br>
Knowledge breaks through trailing its radiant seas,<br>
And Nature trembles with the power, the flame.<br>
A greater Personality sometimes<br>
Possesses us which yet we know is ours:<br>
Or we adore the Master of our souls.<br>
Then the small bodily ego thins and falls;<br>
No more insisting on its separate self,<br>
Losing the punctilio of its separate birth,<br>
It leaves us one with Nature and with God.<br>
In moments when the inner lamps are lit<br>
And the life’s cherished guests are left outside,<br>
Our spirit sits alone and speaks to its gulfs.<br>
<br>

BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
A wider consciousness opens then its doors;<br>
Invading from spiritual silences<br>
A ray of the timeless Glory stoops awhile<br>
To commune with our seized illumined clay<br>
And leaves its huge white stamp upon our lives.<br>
In the oblivious field of mortal mind,<br>
Revealed to the closed prophet eyes of trance<br>
Or in some deep internal solitude<br>
Witnessed by a strange immaterial sense,<br>
The signals of eternity appear.<br>
The truth mind could not know unveils its face,<br>
We hear what mortal ears have never heard,<br>
We feel what earthly sense has never felt,<br>
We love what common hearts repel and dread;<br>
Our minds hush to a bright Omniscient;<br>
A Voice calls from the chambers of the soul;<br>
We meet the ecstasy of the Godhead’s touch<br>
In golden privacies of immortal fire.<br>
These signs are native to a larger self<br>
That lives within us by ourselves unseen;<br>
Only sometimes a holier influence comes,<br>
A tide of mightier surgings bears our lives<br>
And a diviner Presence moves the soul;<br>
Or through the earthly coverings something breaks,<br>
A grace and beauty of spiritual light,<br>
The murmuring tongue of a celestial fire.<br>
Ourself and a high stranger whom we feel,<br>
It is and acts unseen as if it were not;<br>
It follows the line of sempiternal birth,<br>
Yet seems to perish with its mortal frame.<br>
Assured of the Apocalypse to be,<br>
It reckons not the moments and the hours;<br>
Great, patient, calm it sees the centuries pass,<br>
Awaiting the slow miracle of our change<br>
In the sure deliberate process of world-force<br>
And the long march of all-revealing Time.<br>
<br>
48<br>

CANTO IV: The Secret Knowledge<br>
<br>
It is the origin and the master-clue,<br>
A silence overhead, an inner voice,<br>
A living image seated in the heart,<br>
An unwalled wideness and a fathomless point,<br>
The truth of all these cryptic shows in Space,<br>
The Real towards which our strivings move,<br>
The secret grandiose meaning of our lives.<br>
A treasure of honey in the combs of God,<br>
A Splendour burning in a tenebrous cloak,<br>
It is our glory of the flame of God,<br>
Our golden fountain of the world’s delight,<br>
An immortality cowled in the cape of death,<br>
The shape of our unborn divinity.<br>
It guards for us our fate in depths within<br>
Where sleeps the eternal seed of transient things.<br>
Always we bear in us a magic key<br>
Concealed in life’s hermetic envelope.<br>
A burning Witness in the sanctuary<br>
Regards through Time and the blind walls of Form;<br>
A timeless Light is in his hidden eyes;<br>
He sees the secret things no words can speak<br>
And knows the goal of the unconscious world<br>
And the heart of the mystery of the journeying years.<br>
But all is screened, subliminal, mystical;<br>
It needs the intuitive heart, the inward turn,<br>
It needs the power of a spiritual gaze.<br>
Else to our waking mind’s small moment look<br>
A goalless voyage seems our dubious course<br>
Some Chance has settled or hazarded some Will,<br>
Or a Necessity without aim or cause<br>
Unwillingly compelled to emerge and be.<br>
In this dense field where nothing is plain or sure,<br>
Our very being seems to us questionable,<br>
Our life a vague experiment, the soul<br>
A flickering light in a strange ignorant world,<br>
<br>
49<br>
<br>
BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
The earth a brute mechanic accident,<br>
A net of death in which by chance we live.<br>
All we have learned appears a doubtful guess,<br>
The achievement done a passage or a phase<br>
Whose farther end is hidden from our sight,<br>
A chance happening or a fortuitous fate.<br>
Out of the unknown we move to the unknown.<br>
Ever surround our brief existence here<br>
Grey shadows of unanswered questionings;<br>
The dark Inconscient’s signless mysteries<br>
Stand up unsolved behind Fate’s starting-line.<br>
An aspiration in the Night’s profound,<br>
Seed of a perishing body and half-lit mind,<br>
Uplifts its lonely tongue of conscious fire<br>
Towards an undying Light for ever lost;<br>
Only it hears, sole echo of its call,<br>
The dim reply in man’s unknowing heart<br>
And meets, not understanding why it came<br>
Or for what reason is the suffering here,<br>
God’s sanction to the paradox of life<br>
And the riddle of the Immortal’s birth in Time.<br>
Along a path of aeons serpentine<br>
In the coiled blackness of her nescient course<br>
The Earth-Goddess toils across the sands of Time.<br>
A Being is in her whom she hopes to know,<br>
A Word speaks to her heart she cannot hear,<br>
A Fate compels whose form she cannot see.<br>
In her unconscious orbit through the Void<br>
Out of her mindless depths she strives to rise,<br>
A perilous life her gain, a struggling joy;<br>
A Thought that can conceive but hardly knows<br>
Arises slowly in her and creates<br>
The idea, the speech that labels more than it lights;<br>
A trembling gladness that is less than bliss<br>
Invades from all this beauty that must die.<br>
Alarmed by the sorrow dragging at her feet<br>
<br>

<br>
CANTO IV: The Secret Knowledge<br>
<br>
And conscious of the high things not yet won,<br>
Ever she nurses in her sleepless breast<br>
An inward urge that takes from her rest and peace.<br>
Ignorant and weary and invincible,<br>
She seeks through the soul’s war and quivering pain<br>
The pure perfection her marred nature needs,<br>
A breath of Godhead on her stone and mire.<br>
A faith she craves that can survive defeat,<br>
The sweetness of a love that knows not death,<br>
The radiance of a truth for ever sure.<br>
A light grows in her, she assumes a voice,<br>
Her state she learns to read and the act she has done,<br>
But the one needed truth eludes her grasp,<br>
Herself and all of which she is the sign.<br>
An inarticulate whisper drives her steps<br>
Of which she feels the force but not the sense;<br>
A few rare intimations come as guides,<br>
Immense divining flashes cleave her brain,<br>
And sometimes in her hours of dream and muse<br>
The truth that she has missed looks out on her<br>
As if far off and yet within her soul.<br>
A change comes near that flees from her surmise<br>
And, ever postponed, compels attempt and hope,<br>
Yet seems too great for mortal hope to dare.<br>
A vision meets her of supernal Powers<br>
That draw her as if mighty kinsmen lost<br>
Approaching with estranged great luminous gaze.<br>
Then is she moved to all that she is not<br>
And stretches arms to what was never hers.<br>
Outstretching arms to the unconscious Void,<br>
Passionate she prays to invisible forms of Gods<br>
Soliciting from dumb Fate and toiling Time<br>
What most she needs, what most exceeds her scope,<br>
A Mind unvisited by illusion’s gleams,<br>
A Will expressive of soul’s deity,<br>
A Strength not forced to stumble by its speed,<br>

<br>
A Joy that drags not sorrow as its shade.<br>
For these she yearns and feels them destined hers:<br>
Heaven’s privilege she claims as her own right.<br>
Just is her claim the all-witnessing Gods approve,<br>
Clear in a greater light than reason owns:<br>
Our intuitions are its title-deeds;<br>
Our souls accept what our blind thoughts refuse.<br>
Earth’s winged chimaeras are Truth’s steeds in Heaven,<br>
The impossible God’s sign of things to be.<br>
But few can look beyond the present state<br>
Or overleap this matted hedge of sense.<br>
All that transpires on earth and all beyond<br>
Are parts of an illimitable plan<br>
The One keeps in his heart and knows alone.<br>
Our outward happenings have their seed within,<br>
And even this random Fate that imitates Chance,<br>
This mass of unintelligible results,<br>
Are the dumb graph of truths that work unseen:<br>
The laws of the Unknown create the known.<br>
The events that shape the appearance of our lives<br>
Are a cipher of subliminal quiverings<br>
Which rarely we surprise or vaguely feel,<br>
Are an outcome of suppressed realities<br>
That hardly rise into material day:<br>
They are born from the spirit’s sun of hidden powers<br>
Digging a tunnel through emergency.<br>
But who shall pierce into the cryptic gulf<br>
And learn what deep necessity of the soul<br>
Determined casual deed and consequence?<br>
Absorbed in a routine of daily acts,<br>
Our eyes are fixed on an external scene;<br>
We hear the crash of the wheels of Circumstance<br>
And wonder at the hidden cause of things.<br>
Yet a foreseeing Knowledge might be ours,<br>
If we could take our spirit’s stand within,<br>
If we could hear the muffled daemon voice.<br>

<br>
Too seldom is the shadow of what must come<br>
Cast in an instant on the secret sense<br>
Which feels the shock of the invisible,<br>
And seldom in the few who answer give<br>
The mighty process of the cosmic Will<br>
Communicates its image to our sight,<br>
Identifying the world’s mind with ours.<br>
Our range is fixed within the crowded arc<br>
Of what we observe and touch and thought can guess<br>
And rarely dawns the light of the Unknown<br>
Waking in us the prophet and the seer.<br>
The outward and the immediate are our field,<br>
The dead past is our background and support;<br>
Mind keeps the soul prisoner, we are slaves to our acts;<br>
We cannot free our gaze to reach wisdom’s sun.<br>
Inheritor of the brief animal mind,<br>
Man, still a child in Nature’s mighty hands,<br>
In the succession of the moments lives;<br>
To a changing present is his narrow right;<br>
His memory stares back at a phantom past,<br>
The future flees before him as he moves;<br>
He sees imagined garments, not a face.<br>
Armed with a limited precarious strength,<br>
He saves his fruits of work from adverse chance.<br>
A struggling ignorance is his wisdom’s mate:<br>
He waits to see the consequence of his acts,<br>
He waits to weigh the certitude of his thoughts,<br>
He knows not what he shall achieve or when;<br>
He knows not whether at last he shall survive,<br>
Or end like the mastodon and the sloth<br>
And perish from the earth where he was king.<br>
He is ignorant of the meaning of his life,<br>
He is ignorant of his high and splendid fate.<br>

Attentive to an unseen Truth they seize<br>

The murmurs lost by Life’s uncaring ear,<br>

Behind this clock-work Chance and vague surmise,<br>

Across the cries of anguish and of joy,<br>
Across the triumph, fighting and despair,<br>
They watch the Bliss for which earth’s heart has cried<br>
On the long road which cannot see its end<br>
Winding undetected through the sceptic days<br>

An interregnum in Reality<br>
Cuts off the integral Thought, the total Power;<br>
It circles or stands in a vague interspace,<br>
Doubtful of its beginning and its close,<br>
Or runs upon a road that has no end;<br>

Suggested a million renderings to the Mind,<br>
It lends a purport to a random world.<br>
A conjecture leaning upon doubtful proofs,<br>
A message misunderstood, a thought confused<br>
Missing its aim is all that it can speak<br>
Or a fragment of the universal word.<br>
It leaves two giant letters void of sense<br>
While without sanction turns the middle sign<br>
Carrying an enigmatic universe,<br>
As if a present without future or past<br>

Turned on its axis in its own Inane.<br>
Thus is the meaning of creation veiled;<br>
For without context reads the cosmic page:<br>
Its signs stare at us like an unknown script,<br>
As if appeared screened by a foreign tongue<br>
Or code of splendour signs without a key<br>
A portion of a parable sublime.<br>
It wears to the perishable creature’s eyes<br>
The grandeur of a useless miracle;<br>
Wasting itself that it may last awhile,<br>
A river that can never find its sea,<br>
It runs through life and death on an edge of Time;<br>
A fire in the Night is its mighty action’s blaze.<br>
This is our deepest need to join once more<br>
What now is parted, opposite and twain,<br>

Its yearning lasts by their indifference.<br>

He works through the hard breath of battle and toil,<br>
He works through our sins and sorrows and our tears,<br>
His knowledge overrules our nescience;<br>
Whatever the appearance we must bear,<br>
Whatever our strong ills and present fate,<br>
When nothing we can see but drift and bale,<br>
A mighty Guidance leads us still through all.<br>
After we have served this great divided world<br>
God’s bliss and oneness are our inborn right.<br>
A date is fixed in the calendar of the Unknown,<br>
An anniversary of the Birth sublime:<br>
Our soul shall justify its chequered walk,<br>
All will come near that now is naught or far.<br>
These calm and distant Mights shall act at last.<br>
Immovably ready for their destined task,<br>
The ever-wise compassionate Brilliances<br>
Await the sound of the Incarnate’s voice<br>
To leap and bridge the chasms of Ignorance<br>
And heal the hollow yearning gulfs of Life<br>
And fill the abyss that is the universe.<br>

Here meanwhile at the Spirit’s opposite pole<br>
In the mystery of the deeps that God has built<br>
For his abode below the Thinker’s sight,<br>
In this compromise of a stark absolute Truth<br>
With the Light that dwells near the dark end of things,<br>
In this tragi-comedy of divine disguise,<br>
This long far seeking for joy ever near,<br>
In the grandiose dream of which the world is made,<br>
In this gold dome on a black dragon base,<br>
The conscious Force that acts in Nature’s breast,<br>
A dark-robed labourer in the cosmic scheme<br>
Carrying clay images of unborn gods,<br>
Executrix of the inevitable Idea<br>
Hampered, enveloped by the hoops of Fate,<br>
Patient trustee of slow eternal Time,<br>
Absolves from hour to hour her secret charge.<br>
All she foresees in masked imperative depths;<br>
The dumb intention of the unconscious gulfs<br>
Answers to a will that sees upon the heights,<br>
And the evolving Word’s first syllable<br>
Ponderous, brute-sensed, contains its luminous close,<br>
Privy to a summit victory’s vast descent<br>
And the portent of the soul’s immense uprise.<br>
All here where each thing seems its lonely self<br>
Are figures of the sole transcendent One:<br>
Only by him they are, his breath is their life;<br>
An unseen Presence moulds the oblivious clay.<br>
A playmate in the mighty Mother’s game,<br>
One came upon the dubious whirling globe<br>
To hide from her pursuit in force and form.<br>
A secret spirit in the Inconscient’s sleep,<br>
A shapeless Energy, a voiceless Word,<br>
He was here before the elements could emerge,<br>
Before there was light of mind or life could breathe.<br>
Accomplice of her cosmic huge pretence,<br>
<br>

<br>
His semblances he turns to real shapes<br>
And makes the symbol equal with the truth:<br>
He gives to his timeless thoughts a form in Time.<br>
He is the substance, he the self of things;<br>
She has forged from him her works of skill and might:<br>
She wraps him in the magic of her moods<br>
And makes of his myriad truths her countless dreams.<br>
The Master of being has come down to her,<br>
An immortal child born in the fugitive years.<br>
In objects wrought, in the persons she conceives,<br>
Dreaming she chases her idea of him,<br>
And catches here a look and there a gest:<br>
Ever he repeats in them his ceaseless births.<br>
He is the Maker and the world he made,<br>
He is the vision and he is the Seer;<br>
He is himself the actor and the act,<br>
He is himself the knower and the known,<br>
He is himself the dreamer and the dream.<br>
There are Two who are One and play in many worlds;<br>
In Knowledge and Ignorance they have spoken and met<br>
And light and darkness are their eyes’ interchange;<br>
Our pleasure and pain are their wrestle and embrace,<br>
Our deeds, our hopes are intimate to their tale;<br>
They are married secretly in our thought and life.<br>
The universe is an endless masquerade:<br>
For nothing here is utterly what it seems;<br>
It is a dream-fact vision of a truth<br>
Which but for the dream would not be wholly true,<br>
A phenomenon stands out significant<br>
Against dim backgrounds of eternity;<br>
We accept its face and pass by all it means;<br>
A part is seen, we take it for the whole.<br>
Thus have they made their play with us for roles:<br>
Author and actor with himself as scene,<br>
He moves there as the Soul, as Nature she.<br>
Here on the earth where we must fill our parts,<br>
<br>

BOOK I: The Book of Beginnings<br>
<br>
We know not how shall run the drama’s course;<br>
Our uttered sentences veil in their thought.<br>
Her mighty plan she holds back from our sight:<br>
She has concealed her glory and her bliss<br>
And disguised the Love and Wisdom in her heart;<br>
Of all the marvel and beauty that are hers,<br>
Only a darkened little we can feel.<br>
He too wears a diminished godhead here;<br>
He has forsaken his omnipotence,<br>
His calm he has foregone and infinity.<br>
He knows her only, he has forgotten himself;<br>
To her he abandons all to make her great.<br>
He hopes in her to find himself anew,<br>
Incarnate, wedding his infinity’s peace<br>
To her creative passion’s ecstasy.<br>
Although possessor of the earth and heavens,<br>
He leaves to her the cosmic management<br>
And watches all, the Witness of her scene.<br>
A supernumerary on her stage,<br>
He speaks no words or hides behind the wings.<br>
He takes birth in her world, waits on her will,<br>
Divines her enigmatic gesture’s sense,<br>
The fluctuating chance turns of her mood,<br>
Works out her meanings she seems not to know<br>
And serves her secret purpose in long Time.<br>
As one too great for him he worships her;<br>
He adores her as his regent of desire,<br>
He yields to her as the mover of his will,<br>
He burns the incense of his nights and days<br>
Offering his life, a splendour of sacrifice.<br>
A rapt solicitor for her love and grace,<br>
His bliss in her to him is his whole world:<br>
He grows through her in all his being’s powers;<br>
He reads by her God’s hidden aim in things.<br>
Or, a courtier in her countless retinue,<br>
Content to be with her and feel her near<br>
<br>

CANTO IV: The Secret Knowledge<br>
<br>
He makes the most of the little that she gives<br>
And all she does drapes with his own delight.<br>
A glance can make his whole day wonderful,<br>
A word from her lips with happiness wings the hours.<br>
He leans on her for all he does and is:<br>
He builds on her largesses his proud fortunate days<br>
And trails his peacock-plumaged joy of life<br>
And suns in the glory of her passing smile.<br>
In a thousand ways he serves her royal needs;<br>
He makes the hours pivot around her will,<br>
Makes all reflect her whims; all is their play:<br>
This whole wide world is only he and she.<br>
This is the knot that ties together the stars:<br>
The Two who are one are the secret of all power,<br>
The Two who are one are the might and right in things.<br>
His soul, silent, supports the world and her,<br>
His acts are her commandment’s registers.<br>
Happy, inert, he lies beneath her feet:<br>
His breast he offers for her cosmic dance<br>
Of which our lives are the quivering theatre,<br>
And none could bear but for his strength within,<br>
Yet none would leave because of his delight.<br>
His works, his thoughts have been devised by her,<br>
His being is a mirror vast of hers:<br>
Active, inspired by her he speaks and moves;<br>
His deeds obey her heart’s unspoken demands:<br>
Passive, he bears the impacts of the world<br>
As if her touches shaping his soul and life:<br>
His journey through the days is her sun-march;<br>
He runs upon her roads; hers is his course.<br>
A witness and student of her joy and dole,<br>
A partner in her evil and her good,<br>
He has consented to her passionate ways,<br>
He is driven by her sweet and dreadful force.<br>
His sanctioning name initials all her works;<br>

<br>
His silence is his signature to her deeds;<br>
In the execution of her drama’s scheme,<br>
In her fancies of the moment and its mood,<br>
In the march of this obvious ordinary world<br>
Where all is deep and strange to the eyes that see<br>
And Nature’s common forms are marvel-wefts,<br>
She through his witness sight and motion of might<br>
Unrolls the material of her cosmic Act,<br>
Her happenings that exalt and smite the soul,<br>
Her force that moves, her powers that save and slay,<br>
Her Word that in the silence speaks to our hearts,<br>
Her silence that transcends the summit Word,<br>
Her heights and depths to which our spirit moves,<br>
Her events that weave the texture of our lives<br>
And all by which we find or lose ourselves,<br>
Things sweet and bitter, magnificent and mean,<br>
Things terrible and beautiful and divine.<br>
Her empire in the cosmos she has built,<br>
He is governed by her subtle and mighty laws.<br>
His consciousness is a babe upon her knees,<br>
His being a field of her vast experiment,<br>
Her endless space is the playground of his thoughts;<br>
She binds to knowledge of the shapes of Time<br>
And the creative error of limiting mind<br>
And chance that wears the rigid face of fate<br>
And her sport of death and pain and Nescience,<br>
His changed and struggling immortality.<br>
His soul is a subtle atom in a mass,<br>
His substance a material for her works.<br>
His spirit survives amid the death of things,<br>
He climbs to eternity through being’s gaps,<br>
He is carried by her from Night to deathless Light.<br>
This grand surrender is his free-will’s gift,<br>
His pure transcendent force submits to hers.<br>

In the insoluble riddle of her play,<br>

A creature made of perishable stuff,<br>
In the pattern she has set for him he moves,<br>
He thinks with her thoughts, with her trouble his bosom heaves;<br>
He seems the thing that she would have him seem,<br>
He is whatever her artist will can make.<br>
Although she drives him on her fancy’s roads,<br>
At play with him as with her child or slave,<br>
To freedom and the Eternal’s mastery<br>
And immortality’s stand above the world,<br>
She moves her seeming puppet of an hour.<br>
Even in his mortal session in body’s house,<br>
An aimless traveller between birth and death,<br>
Ephemeral dreaming of immortality,<br>
To reign she spurs him. He takes up her powers;<br>
He has harnessed her to the yoke of her own law.<br>
His face of human thought puts on a crown.<br>
Held in her leash, bound to her veiled caprice,<br>
He studies her ways if so he may prevail<br>
Even for an hour and she work out his will;<br>
He makes of her his moment passion’s serf:<br>
To obey she feigns, she follows her creature’s lead:<br>
For him she was made, lives only for his use.<br>
But conquering her, then is he most her slave;<br>
He is her dependent, all his means are hers;<br>
Nothing without her he can, she rules him still.<br>
At last he wakes to a memory of Self:<br>
He sees within the face of deity,<br>
The Godhead breaks out through the human mould:<br>
Her highest heights she unmasks and is his mate.<br>
Till then he is a plaything in her game;<br>
Her seeming regent, yet her fancy’s toy,<br>
A living robot moved by her energy’s springs,<br>
He acts as in the movements of a dream,<br>
An automaton stepping in the grooves of Fate,<br>
He stumbles on driven by her whip of Force:<br>
His thought labours, a bullock in Time’s fields;<br>
<br>

His will he thinks his own, is shaped in her forge.<br>
Obedient to World-Nature’s dumb control,<br>
Driven by his own formidable Power,<br>
His chosen partner in a titan game,<br>
Her will he has made the master of his fate,<br>
Her whim the dispenser of his pleasure and pain;<br>
He has sold himself into her regal power<br>
For any blow or boon that she may choose:<br>
Even in what is suffering to our sense,<br>
He feels the sweetness of her mastering touch,<br>
In all experience meets her blissful hands;<br>
On his heart he bears the happiness of her tread<br>
And the surprise of her arrival’s joy<br>
In each event and every moment’s chance.<br>
All she can do is marvellous in his sight:<br>
He revels in her, a swimmer in her sea,<br>
A tireless amateur of her world-delight,<br>
He rejoices in her every thought and act<br>
And gives consent to all that she can wish;<br>
Whatever she desires he wills to be:<br>
The Spirit, the innumerable One,<br>
He has left behind his lone eternity,<br>
He is an endless birth in endless Time,<br>
Her finite’s multitude in an infinite Space.<br>
The master of existence lurks in us<br>
And plays at hide-and-seek with his own Force;<br>
In Nature’s instrument loiters secret God.<br>

He has made the universe his pastime’s field,<br>
A vast gymnasium of his works of might.<br>

Immortal, dallies with mortality.<br>

And drinks experience like a strengthening wine.<br>
He whose transcendence rules the pregnant Vasts,<br>
Prescient now dwells in our subliminal depths,<br>
A luminous individual Power, alone.<br>
The Absolute, the Perfect, the Alone<br>
Has called out of the Silence his mute Force<br>
Where she lay in the featureless and formless hush<br>
Guarding from Time by her immobile sleep<br>
The ineffable puissance of his solitude.<br>
The Absolute, the Perfect, the Alone<br>
Has entered with his silence into space:<br>
He has fashioned these countless persons of one self;<br>
He has built a million figures of his power;<br>
He lives in all, who lived in his Vast alone;<br>
Space is himself and Time is only he.<br>
The Absolute, the Perfect, the Immune,<br>
One who is in us as our secret self,<br>
Our mask of imperfection has assumed,<br>
He has made this tenement of flesh his own,<br>
His image in the human measure cast<br>
That to his divine measure we might rise;<br>
Then in a figure of divinity<br>
The Maker shall recast us and impose<br>
A plan of godhead on the mortal’s mould<br>

A mutual debt binds man to the Supreme:<br>

But meanwhile all is a shadow cast by a dream<br>
And to the musing and immobile spirit<br>
Life and himself don the aspect of a myth,<br>
The burden of a long unmeaning tale.<br>
For the key is hid and by the Inconscient kept;<br>
The secret God beneath the threshold dwells.<br>
In a body obscuring the immortal Spirit<br>
A nameless Resident vesting unseen powers<br>
With Matter’s shapes and motives beyond thought<br>
And the hazard of an unguessed consequence,<br>
An omnipotent indiscernible Influence,<br>
He sits, unfelt by the form in which he lives<br>
And veils his knowledge by the groping mind.<br>
A wanderer in a world his thoughts have made,<br>
He turns in a chiaroscuro of error and truth<br>
To find a wisdom that on high is his.<br>
As one forgetting he searches for himself;<br>
As if he had lost an inner light he seeks:<br>
As a sojourner lingering amid alien scenes<br>
He journeys to a home he knows no more.<br>
His own self’s truth he seeks who is the Truth;<br>
He is the Player who became the play,<br>
He is the Thinker who became the thought;<br>
He is the many who was the silent One.<br>
In the symbol figures of the cosmic Force<br>
And in her living and inanimate signs<br>
And in her complex tracery of events<br>
He explores the ceaseless miracle of himself,<br>
Till the thousandfold enigma has been solved<br>
In the single light of an all-witnessing Soul.<br>
This was his compact with his mighty mate,<br>
For love of her and joined to her for ever<br>
To follow the course of Time’s eternity,<br>

And the vicissitudes of her vast caprice.<br>

Two seem his goals, yet ever are they one<br>
And gaze at each other over bourneless Time;<br>

Of the great Mother’s wide uncharted will<br>
And the rude enigma of her terrestrial ways<br>
He is the explorer and the mariner<br>
On a secret inner ocean without bourne:<br>

Of a magic earth’s obscure geography.<br>
In her material order’s fixed design<br>
Where all seems sure and, even when changed, the same,<br>
Even though the end is left for ever unknown<br>
And ever unstable is life’s shifting flow,<br>
His paths are found for him by silent fate;<br>
As stations in the ages’ weltering flood<br>
Firm lands appear that tempt and stay awhile,<br>
Then new horizons lure the mind’s advance.<br>
There comes no close to the finite’s boundlessness,<br>
There is no last certitude in which thought can pause<br>
And no terminus to the soul’s experience.<br>
A limit, a farness never wholly reached,<br>
An unattained perfection calls to him<br>
From distant boundaries in the Unseen:<br>
A long beginning only has been made.<br>
This is the sailor on the flow of Time,<br>

At first he hugs the shore and shuns the breadths,<br>
Dares not to affront the far-off perilous main.<br>
He in a petty coastal traffic plies,<br>
His pay doled out from port to neighbour port,<br>
Content with his safe round’s unchanging course,<br>
He hazards not the new and the unseen.<br>
But now he hears the sound of larger seas.<br>
A widening world calls him to distant scenes<br>
And journeyings in a larger vision’s arc<br>
And peoples unknown and still unvisited shores.<br>
On a commissioned keel his merchant hull<br>
Serves the world’s commerce in the riches of Time<br>
Severing the foam of a great land-locked sea<br>
To reach unknown harbour lights in distant climes<br>
And open markets for life’s opulent arts,<br>
Rich bales, carved statuettes, hued canvases,<br>
And jewelled toys brought for an infant’s play<br>
And perishable products of hard toil<br>
And transient splendours won and lost by the days.<br>
Or passing through a gate of pillar-rocks,<br>
Venturing not yet to cross oceans unnamed<br>
And journey into a dream of distances<br>

And finds new haven in storm-troubled isles,<br>

Into Eyes that look upon eternity.<br>
A greater world Time’s traveller must explore.<br>
At last he hears a chanting on the heights<br>
And the far speaks and the unknown grows near:<br>
He crosses the boundaries of the unseen<br>
And passes over the edge of mortal sight<br>
To a new vision of himself and things.<br>
He is a spirit in an unfinished world<br>
That knows him not and cannot know itself:<br>
The surface symbol of his goalless quest<br>
Takes deeper meanings to his inner view;<br>
His is a search of darkness for the light,<br>
Of mortal life for immortality.<br>
In the vessel of an earthly embodiment<br>
Over the narrow rails of limiting sense<br>
He looks out on the magic waves of Time<br>
Where mind like a moon illumines the world’s dark.<br>
There is limned ever retreating from the eyes,<br>
As if in a tenuous misty dream-light drawn,<br>
The outline of a dim mysterious shore.<br>
A sailor on the Inconscient’s fathomless sea,<br>
He voyages through a starry world of thought<br>
On Matter’s deck to a spiritual sun.<br>

Across the rapt unknowable silences,<br>
Through a strange mid-world under supernal skies,<br>
Beyond earth’s longitudes and latitudes,<br>
His goal is fixed outside all present maps.<br>
But none learns whither through the unknown he sails<br>

Driven by her breath across life’s tossing deep,<br>

Late will he know, opening the mystic script,<br>
Whether to a blank port in the Unseen<br>
He goes or, armed with her fiat, to discover<br>
A new mind and body in the city of God<br>
And enshrine the Immortal in his glory’s house<br>

There is a plan in the Mother’s deep world-whim,<br>
A purpose in her vast and random game.<br>
This ever she meant since the first dawn of life,<br>

To evoke a Person in the impersonal Void,<br>

THIS knowledge first he had of time-born men.<br>
Admitted through a curtain of bright mind<br>
That hangs between our thoughts and absolute sight,<br>
He found the occult cave, the mystic door<br>
Near to the well of vision in the soul,<br>
And entered where the Wings of Glory brood<br>
In the silent space where all is for ever known.<br>
Indifferent to doubt and to belief,<br>
Avid of the naked real’s single shock<br>
He shore the cord of mind that ties the earth-heart<br>
And cast away the yoke of Matter’s law.<br>
The body’s rules bound not the spirit’s powers:<br>
When life had stopped its beats, death broke not in;<br>
He dared to live when breath and thought were still.<br>
Thus could he step into that magic place<br>
Which few can even glimpse with hurried glance<br>
Lifted for a moment from mind’s laboured works<br>
And the poverty of Nature’s earthly sight.<br>
All that the Gods have learned is there self-known.<br>
There in a hidden chamber closed and mute<br>
Are kept the record graphs of the cosmic scribe,<br>
And there the tables of the sacred Law,<br>
There is the Book of Being’s index page;<br>
The text and glossary of the Vedic truth<br>
Are there; the rhythms and metres of the stars<br>
Significant of the movements of our fate:<br>
The symbol powers of number and of form,<br>
And the secret code of the history of the world<br>
And Nature’s correspondence with the soul<br>
Are written in the mystic heart of Life.<br>

In the glow of the spirit’s room of memories<br>
He could recover the luminous marginal notes<br>
Dotting with light the crabbed ambiguous scroll,<br>
Rescue the preamble and the saving clause<br>
Of the dark Agreement by which all is ruled<br>
That rises from material Nature’s sleep<br>
To clothe the Everlasting in new shapes.<br>
He could re-read now and interpret new<br>
Its strange symbol letters, scattered abstruse signs,<br>
Resolve its oracle and its paradox,<br>
Its riddling phrases and its blindfold terms,<br>
The deep oxymoron of its truth’s repliques,<br>
And recognise as a just necessity<br>
Its hard conditions for the mighty work, —<br>
Nature’s impossible Herculean toil<br>
Only her warlock-wisecraft could enforce,<br>
Its law of the opposition of the gods,<br>
Its list of inseparable contraries.<br>
The dumb great Mother in her cosmic trance<br>
Exploiting for creation’s joy and pain<br>
Infinity’s sanction to the birth of form,<br>
Accepts indomitably to execute<br>
The will to know in an inconscient world,<br>
The will to live under a reign of death,<br>
The thirst for rapture in a heart of flesh,<br>
And works out through the appearance of a soul<br>
By a miraculous birth in plasm and gas<br>
The mystery of God’s covenant with the Night.<br>
Once more was heard in the still cosmic Mind<br>
The Eternal’s promise to his labouring Force<br>
Inducing the world-passion to begin,<br>
The cry of birth into mortality<br>
And the opening verse of the tragedy of Time.<br>
Out of the depths the world’s buried secret rose;<br>
He read the original ukase kept back<br>
In the locked archives of the spirit’s crypt,<br>

And saw the signature and fiery seal<br>
Of Wisdom on the dim Power’s hooded work<br>
Who builds in Ignorance the steps of Light.<br>
A sleeping deity opened deathless eyes:<br>
He saw the unshaped thought in soulless forms,<br>
Knew Matter pregnant with spiritual sense,<br>
Mind dare the study of the Unknowable,<br>
Life its gestation of the Golden Child.<br>
In the light flooding thought’s blank vacancy,<br>
Interpreting the universe by soul signs<br>
He read from within the text of the without:<br>
The riddle grew plain and lost its catch obscure.<br>
A larger lustre lit the mighty page.<br>
A purpose mingled with the whims of Time,<br>
A meaning met the stumbling pace of Chance<br>
And Fate revealed a chain of seeing Will;<br>
A conscious wideness filled the old dumb Space.<br>
In the Void he saw throned the Omniscience supreme.<br>
A Will, a hope immense now seized his heart,<br>
And to discern the superhuman’s form<br>
He raised his eyes to unseen spiritual heights,<br>
Aspiring to bring down a greater world.<br>
The glory he had glimpsed must be his home.<br>
A brighter heavenlier sun must soon illume<br>
This dusk room with its dark internal stair,<br>
The infant soul in its small nursery school<br>
Mid objects meant for a lesson hardly learned<br>
Outgrow its early grammar of intellect<br>
And its imitation of Earth-Nature’s art,<br>
Its earthly dialect to God-language change,<br>
In living symbols study Reality<br>
And learn the logic of the Infinite.<br>
The Ideal must be Nature’s common truth,<br>
The body illumined with the indwelling God,<br>
The heart and mind feel one with all that is,<br>

A conscious soul live in a conscious world.<br>
As through a mist a sovereign peak is seen,<br>
The greatness of the eternal Spirit appeared,<br>
Exiled in a fragmented universe<br>
Amid half-semblances of diviner things.<br>
These now could serve no more his regal turn;<br>
The Immortal’s pride refused the doom to live<br>
A miser of the scanty bargain made<br>
Between our littleness and bounded hopes<br>
And the compassionate Infinitudes.<br>
His height repelled the lowness of earth’s state:<br>
A wideness discontented with its frame<br>
Resiled from poor assent to Nature’s terms,<br>
The harsh contract spurned and the diminished lease.<br>
Only beginnings are accomplished here;<br>
Our base’s Matter seems alone complete,<br>
An absolute machine without a soul.<br>
Or all seems a misfit of half ideas,<br>
Or we saddle with the vice of earthly form<br>
A hurried imperfect glimpse of heavenly things,<br>
Guesses and travesties of celestial types.<br>
Here chaos sorts itself into a world,<br>
A brief formation drifting in the void:<br>
Apings of knowledge, unfinished arcs of power,<br>
Flamings of beauty into earthly shapes,<br>
Love’s broken reflexes of unity<br>
Swim, fragment-mirrorings of a floating sun.<br>
A packed assemblage of crude tentative lives<br>
Are pieced into a tessellated whole.<br>
There is no perfect answer to our hopes;<br>
There are blind voiceless doors that have no key;<br>
Thought climbs in vain and brings a borrowed light,<br>
Cheated by counterfeits sold to us in life’s mart,<br>
Our hearts clutch at a forfeited heavenly bliss.<br>
There is provender for the mind’s satiety,<br>
There are thrills of the flesh, but not the soul’s desire.<br>

Here even the highest rapture Time can give<br>
Is a mimicry of ungrasped beatitudes,<br>
A mutilated statue of ecstasy,<br>
A wounded happiness that cannot live,<br>
A brief felicity of mind or sense<br>
Thrown by the World-Power to her body-slave,<br>
Or a simulacrum of enforced delight<br>
In the seraglios of Ignorance.<br>
For all we have acquired soon loses worth,<br>
An old disvalued credit in Time’s bank,<br>
Imperfection’s cheque drawn on the Inconscient.<br>
An inconsequence dogs every effort made,<br>
And chaos waits on every cosmos formed:<br>
In each success a seed of failure lurks.<br>
He saw the doubtfulness of all things here,<br>
The incertitude of man’s proud confident thought,<br>
The transience of the achievements of his force.<br>
A thinking being in an unthinking world,<br>
An island in the sea of the Unknown,<br>
He is a smallness trying to be great,<br>
An animal with some instincts of a god,<br>
His life a story too common to be told,<br>
His deeds a number summing up to nought,<br>
His consciousness a torch lit to be quenched,<br>
His hope a star above a cradle and grave.<br>
And yet a greater destiny may be his,<br>
For the eternal Spirit is his truth.<br>
He can re-create himself and all around<br>
And fashion new the world in which he lives:<br>
He, ignorant, is the Knower beyond Time,<br>
He is the Self above Nature, above Fate.<br>
His soul retired from all that he had done.<br>
Hushed was the futile din of human toil,<br>
Forsaken wheeled the circle of the days;<br>
In distance sank the crowded tramp of life.<br>

The Silence was his sole companion left.<br>
Impassive he lived immune from earthly hopes,<br>
A figure in the ineffable Witness’ shrine<br>
Pacing the vast cathedral of his thoughts<br>
Under its arches dim with infinity<br>
And heavenward brooding of invisible wings.<br>
A call was on him from intangible heights;<br>
Indifferent to the little outpost Mind,<br>
He dwelt in the wideness of the Eternal’s reign.<br>
His being now exceeded thinkable Space,<br>
His boundless thought was neighbour to cosmic sight:<br>
A universal light was in his eyes,<br>
A golden influx flowed through heart and brain;<br>
A Force came down into his mortal limbs,<br>
A current from eternal seas of Bliss;<br>
He felt the invasion and the nameless joy.<br>
Aware of his occult omnipotent Source,<br>
Allured by the omniscient Ecstasy,<br>
A living centre of the Illimitable<br>
Widened to equate with the world’s circumference,<br>
He turned to his immense spiritual fate.<br>
Abandoned on a canvas of torn air,<br>
A picture lost in far and fading streaks,<br>
The earth-nature’s summits sank below his feet:<br>
He climbed to meet the infinite more above.<br>
The Immobile’s ocean-silence saw him pass,<br>
An arrow leaping through eternity<br>
Suddenly shot from the tense bow of Time,<br>
A ray returning to its parent sun.<br>
Opponent of that glory of escape,<br>
The black Inconscient swung its dragon tail<br>
Lashing a slumbrous Infinite by its force<br>
Into the deep obscurities of form:<br>
Death lay beneath him like a gate of sleep.<br>
One-pointed to the immaculate Delight,<br>
Questing for God as for a splendid prey,<br>

He mounted burning like a cone of fire.<br>
To a few is given that godlike rare release.<br>
One among many thousands never touched,<br>
Engrossed in the external world’s design,<br>
Is chosen by a secret witness Eye<br>
And driven by a pointing hand of Light<br>
Across his soul’s unmapped immensitudes.<br>
A pilgrim of the everlasting Truth,<br>
Our measures cannot hold his measureless mind;<br>
He has turned from the voices of the narrow realm<br>
And left the little lane of human Time.<br>
In the hushed precincts of a vaster plan<br>
He treads the vestibules of the Unseen,<br>
Or listens following a bodiless Guide<br>
To a lonely cry in boundless vacancy.<br>
All the deep cosmic murmur falling still,<br>
He lives in the hush before the world was born,<br>
His soul left naked to the timeless One.<br>
Far from compulsion of created things<br>
Thought and its shadowy idols disappear,<br>
The moulds of form and person are undone:<br>
The ineffable Wideness knows him for its own.<br>
A lone forerunner of the Godward earth,<br>
Among the symbols of yet unshaped things<br>
Watched by closed eyes, mute faces of the Unborn,<br>
He journeys to meet the Incommunicable,<br>
Hearing the echo of his single steps<br>
In the eternal courts of Solitude.<br>
A nameless Marvel fills the motionless hours.<br>
His spirit mingles with eternity’s heart<br>
And bears the silence of the Infinite.<br>
In a divine retreat from mortal thought,<br>
In a prodigious gesture of soul-sight,<br>
His being towered into pathless heights,<br>
Naked of its vesture of humanity.<br>

As thus it rose, to meet him bare and pure<br>
A strong Descent leaped down. A Might, a Flame,<br>
A Beauty half-visible with deathless eyes,<br>
A violent Ecstasy, a Sweetness dire,<br>
Enveloped him with its stupendous limbs<br>
And penetrated nerve and heart and brain<br>
That thrilled and fainted with the epiphany:<br>
His nature shuddered in the Unknown’s grasp.<br>
In a moment shorter than death, longer than Time,<br>
By a Power more ruthless than Love, happier than Heaven,<br>
Taken sovereignly into eternal arms,<br>
Haled and coerced by a stark absolute bliss,<br>
In a whirlwind circuit of delight and force<br>
Hurried into unimaginable depths,<br>
Upborne into immeasurable heights,<br>
It was torn out from its mortality<br>
And underwent a new and bourneless change.<br>
An Omniscient knowing without sight or thought,<br>
An indecipherable Omnipotence,<br>
A mystic Form that could contain the worlds,<br>
Yet make one human breast its passionate shrine,<br>
Drew him out of his seeking loneliness<br>
Into the magnitudes of God’s embrace.<br>
As when a timeless Eye annuls the hours<br>
Abolishing the agent and the act,<br>
So now his spirit shone out wide, blank, pure:<br>
His wakened mind became an empty slate<br>
On which the Universal and Sole could write.<br>
All that represses our fallen consciousness<br>
Was taken from him like a forgotten load:<br>
A fire that seemed the body of a god<br>
Consumed the limiting figures of the past<br>
And made large room for a new self to live.<br>
Eternity’s contact broke the moulds of sense.<br>
A greater Force than the earthly held his limbs,<br>
Huge workings bared his undiscovered sheaths,<br>

There reached through forms to the hidden absolute<br>
A cosmic feeling and transcendent sight.<br>
Increased and heightened were the instruments.<br>
Illusion lost her aggrandising lens;<br>
As from her failing hand the measures fell,<br>
Atomic looked the things that loomed so large.<br>
The little ego’s ring could join no more;<br>
In the enormous spaces of the self<br>
The body now seemed only a wandering shell,<br>
His mind the many-frescoed outer court<br>
Of an imperishable Inhabitant:<br>
His spirit breathed a superhuman air.<br>
The imprisoned deity rent its magic fence.<br>
As with a sound of thunder and of seas,<br>
Vast barriers crashed around the huge escape.<br>
Immutably coeval with the world,<br>
Circle and end of every hope and toil<br>
Inexorably drawn round thought and act,<br>
The fixed immovable peripheries<br>
Effaced themselves beneath the Incarnate’s tread.<br>
The dire velamen and the bottomless crypt<br>
Between which life and thought for ever move,<br>
Forbidden still to cross the dim dread bounds,<br>
The guardian darknesses mute and formidable,<br>
Empowered to circumscribe the wingless spirit<br>
In the boundaries of Mind and Ignorance,<br>
Protecting no more a dual eternity<br>
Vanished rescinding their enormous role:<br>
Once figure of creation’s vain ellipse,<br>

Could not restrain the swift arisen God:<br>
Abolished were the scripts of destiny.<br>
There was no small death-hunted creature more,<br>
No fragile form of being to preserve<br>
From an all-swallowing Immensity.<br>

Burst open the narrow dams that keep us safe<br>
Against the forces of the universe.<br>

A boundless being in a measureless Time<br>
Invaded Nature with the infinite;<br>
He saw unpathed, unwalled, his titan scope.<br>
All was uncovered to his sealless eye.<br>
A secret Nature stripped of her defence,<br>
Once in a dreaded half-light formidable,<br>
Overtaken in her mighty privacy<br>
Lay bare to the burning splendour of his will.<br>
In shadowy chambers lit by a strange sun<br>
And opening hardly to hid mystic keys<br>
Her perilous arcanes and hooded Powers<br>
Confessed the advent of a mastering Mind<br>
And bore the compulsion of a time-born gaze.<br>
Incalculable in their wizard modes,<br>
Immediate and invincible in the act,<br>
Her secret strengths native to greater worlds<br>
Lifted above our needy limited scope,<br>
The occult privilege of demigods<br>
And the sure power-pattern of her cryptic signs,<br>
Her diagrams of geometric force,<br>

Beyond our indigent corporeal range.<br>
There he could enter, there awhile abide.<br>
A voyager upon uncharted routes<br>
Fronting the viewless danger of the Unknown,<br>
Adventuring across enormous realms,<br>
He broke into another Space and Time.<br>

ALONE he moved watched by the infinity<br>
Around him and the Unknowable above.<br>
All could be seen that shuns the mortal eye,<br>
All could be known the mind has never grasped;<br>
All could be done no mortal will can dare.<br>
A limitless movement filled a limitless peace.<br>
In a profound existence beyond earth’s<br>
Parent or kin to our ideas and dreams<br>
Where Space is a vast experiment of the soul,<br>
In an immaterial substance linked to ours<br>
In a deep oneness of all things that are,<br>
The universe of the Unknown arose.<br>
A self-creation without end or pause<br>
Revealed the grandeurs of the Infinite:<br>
It flung into the hazards of its play<br>
A million moods, a myriad energies,<br>
The world-shapes that are fancies of its Truth<br>
And the formulas of the freedom of its Force.<br>
It poured into the Ever-stable’s flux<br>
A bacchic rapture and revel of Ideas,<br>
A passion and motion of everlastingness.<br>
There rose unborn into the Unchanging’s surge<br>
Thoughts that abide in their deathless consequence,<br>
Words that immortal last though fallen mute,<br>
Acts that brought out from Silence its dumb sense,<br>
Lines that convey the inexpressible.<br>
The Eternal’s stillness saw in unmoved joy<br>
His universal Power at work display<br>
In plots of pain and dramas of delight<br>
The wonder and beauty of her will to be.<br>
All, even pain, was the soul’s pleasure here;<br>

<br>
Here all experience was a single plan,<br>
The thousandfold expression of the One.<br>
All came at once into his single view;<br>
Nothing escaped his vast intuitive sight,<br>
Nothing drew near he could not feel as kin:<br>
He was one spirit with that immensity.<br>
Images in a supernal consciousness<br>
Embodying the Unborn who never dies,<br>
The structured visions of the cosmic Self<br>
Alive with the touch of being’s eternity<br>
Looked at him like form-bound spiritual thoughts<br>
Figuring the movements of the Ineffable.<br>
Aspects of being donned world-outline; forms<br>
That open moving doors on things divine,<br>
Became familiar to his hourly sight;<br>
The symbols of the Spirit’s reality,<br>
The living bodies of the Bodiless<br>
Grew near to him, his daily associates.<br>
The exhaustless seeings of the unsleeping Mind,<br>
Letterings of its contact with the invisible,<br>
Surrounded him with countless pointing signs;<br>
The voices of a thousand realms of Life<br>
Missioned to him her mighty messages.<br>
The heaven-hints that invade our earthly lives,<br>
The dire imaginations dreamed by Hell,<br>
Which if enacted and experienced here<br>
Our dulled capacity soon would cease to feel<br>
Or our mortal frailty could not long endure,<br>
Were set in their sublime proportions there.<br>
There lived out in their self-born atmosphere,<br>
They resumed their topless pitch and native power;<br>
Their fortifying stress upon the soul<br>
Bit deep into the ground of consciousness<br>
The passion and purity of their extremes,<br>
The absoluteness of their single cry<br>
And the sovereign sweetness or violent poetry<br>

Of their beautiful or terrible delight.<br>
All thought can know or widest sight perceive<br>
And all that thought and sight can never know,<br>
All things occult and rare, remote and strange<br>
Were near to heart’s contact, felt by spirit-sense.<br>
Asking for entry at his nature’s gates<br>
They crowded the widened spaces of his mind,<br>
His self-discovery’s flaming witnesses,<br>
Offering their marvel and their multitude.<br>
These now became new portions of himself,<br>
The figures of his spirit’s greater life,<br>
The moving scenery of his large time-walk<br>
Or the embroidered tissue of his sense:<br>
These took the place of intimate human things<br>
And moved as close companions of his thoughts,<br>
Or were his soul’s natural environment.<br>
Tireless the heart’s adventure of delight,<br>
Endless the kingdoms of the Spirit’s bliss,<br>
Unnumbered tones struck from one harmony’s strings;<br>
Each to its wide-winged universal poise,<br>
Its fathomless feeling of the All in one,<br>
Brought notes of some perfection yet unseen,<br>
Its single retreat into Truth’s secrecies,<br>
Its happy sidelight on the Infinite.<br>
All was found there the Unique has dreamed and made<br>
Tinging with ceaseless rapture and surprise<br>
And an opulent beauty of passionate difference<br>
The recurring beat that moments God in Time.<br>
Only was missing the sole timeless Word<br>
That carries eternity in its lonely sound,<br>
The Idea self-luminous key to all ideas,<br>
The integer of the Spirit’s perfect sum<br>
That equates the unequal All to the equal One,<br>
The single sign interpreting every sign,<br>
The absolute index to the Absolute.<br>

There walled apart by its own innerness<br>
In a mystical barrage of dynamic light<br>
He saw a lone immense high-curved world-pile<br>
Erect like a mountain-chariot of the Gods<br>
Motionless under an inscrutable sky.<br>
As if from Matter’s plinth and viewless base<br>
To a top as viewless, a carved sea of worlds<br>
Climbing with foam-maned waves to the Supreme<br>
Ascended towards breadths immeasurable;<br>
It hoped to soar into the Ineffable’s reign:<br>
A hundred levels raised it to the Unknown.<br>
So it towered up to heights intangible<br>
And disappeared in the hushed conscious Vast<br>
As climbs a storeyed temple-tower to heaven<br>
Built by the aspiring soul of man to live<br>
Near to his dream of the Invisible.<br>
Infinity calls to it as it dreams and climbs;<br>
Its spire touches the apex of the world;<br>
Mounting into great voiceless stillnesses<br>
It marries the earth to screened eternities.<br>
Amid the many systems of the One<br>
Made by an interpreting creative joy<br>
Alone it points us to our journey back<br>
Out of our long self-loss in Nature’s deeps;<br>
Planted on earth it holds in it all realms:<br>
It is a brief compendium of the Vast.<br>
This was the single stair to being’s goal.<br>
A summary of the stages of the spirit,<br>
Its copy of the cosmic hierarchies<br>
Refashioned in our secret air of self<br>
A subtle pattern of the universe.<br>
It is within, below, without, above.<br>
Acting upon this visible Nature’s scheme<br>
It wakens our earth-matter’s heavy doze<br>
To think and feel and to react to joy;<br>
It models in us our diviner parts,<br>

Lifts mortal mind into a greater air,<br>
Makes yearn this life of flesh to intangible aims,<br>
Links the body’s death with immortality’s call:<br>
Out of the swoon of the Inconscience<br>
It labours towards a superconscient Light.<br>
If earth were all and this were not in her,<br>
Thought could not be nor life-delight’s response:<br>
Only material forms could then be her guests<br>
Driven by an inanimate world-force.<br>
Earth by this golden superfluity<br>
Bore thinking man and more than man shall bear;<br>
This higher scheme of being is our cause<br>
And holds the key to our ascending fate;<br>
It calls out of our dense mortality<br>
The conscious spirit nursed in Matter’s house.<br>
The living symbol of these conscious planes,<br>
Its influences and godheads of the unseen,<br>
Its unthought logic of Reality’s acts<br>
Arisen from the unspoken truth in things,<br>
Have fixed our inner life’s slow-scaled degrees.<br>
Its steps are paces of the soul’s return<br>
From the deep adventure of material birth,<br>
A ladder of delivering ascent<br>
And rungs that Nature climbs to deity.<br>
Once in the vigil of a deathless gaze<br>
These grades had marked her giant downward plunge,<br>
The wide and prone leap of a godhead’s fall.<br>
Our life is a holocaust of the Supreme.<br>
The great World-Mother by her sacrifice<br>
Has made her soul the body of our state;<br>
Accepting sorrow and unconsciousness<br>
Divinity’s lapse from its own splendours wove<br>
The many-patterned ground of all we are.<br>
An idol of self is our mortality.<br>
Our earth is a fragment and a residue;<br>
Her power is packed with the stuff of greater worlds<br>

And steeped in their colour-lustres dimmed by her drowse;<br>
An atavism of higher births is hers,<br>
Her sleep is stirred by their buried memories<br>
Recalling the lost spheres from which they fell.<br>
Unsatisfied forces in her bosom move;<br>
They are partners of her greater growing fate<br>
And her return to immortality;<br>
They consent to share her doom of birth and death;<br>
They kindle partial gleams of the All and drive<br>
Her blind laborious spirit to compose<br>
A meagre image of the mighty Whole.<br>
The calm and luminous Intimacy within<br>
Approves her work and guides the unseeing Power.<br>
His vast design accepts a puny start.<br>
An attempt, a drawing half-done is the world’s life;<br>
Its lines doubt their concealed significance,<br>
Its curves join not their high intended close.<br>
Yet some first image of greatness trembles there,<br>
And when the ambiguous crowded parts have met<br>
The many-toned unity to which they moved,<br>
The Artist’s joy shall laugh at reason’s rules;<br>
The divine intention suddenly shall be seen,<br>
The end vindicate intuition’s sure technique.<br>
A graph shall be of many meeting worlds,<br>
A cube and union-crystal of the gods;<br>
A Mind shall think behind Nature’s mindless mask,<br>
A conscious Vast fill the old dumb brute Space.<br>
This faint and fluid sketch of soul called man<br>
Shall stand out on the background of long Time<br>
A glowing epitome of eternity,<br>
A little point reveal the infinitudes.<br>
A Mystery’s process is the universe.<br>
At first was laid a strange anomalous base,<br>
A void, a cipher of some secret Whole,<br>
Where zero held infinity in its sum<br>
And All and Nothing were a single term,<br>

An eternal negative, a matrix Nought:<br>
Into its forms the Child is ever born<br>
Who lives for ever in the vasts of God.<br>
A slow reversal’s movement then took place:<br>
A gas belched out from some invisible Fire,<br>
Of its dense rings were formed these million stars;<br>
Upon earth’s new-born soil God’s tread was heard.<br>
Across the thick smoke of earth’s ignorance<br>
A Mind began to see and look at forms<br>
And groped for knowledge in the nescient Night:<br>
Caught in a blind stone-grip Force worked its plan<br>
And made in sleep this huge mechanical world,<br>
That Matter might grow conscious of its soul<br>
And like a busy midwife the life-power<br>
Deliver the zero carrier of the All.<br>
Because eternal eyes turned on earth’s gulfs<br>
The lucent clarity of a pure regard<br>
And saw a shadow of the Unknowable<br>
Mirrored in the Inconscient’s boundless sleep,<br>
Creation’s search for self began its stir.<br>
A spirit dreamed in the crude cosmic whirl,<br>
Mind flowed unknowing in the sap of life<br>
And Matter’s breasts suckled the divine Idea.<br>
A miracle of the Absolute was born;<br>
Infinity put on a finite soul,<br>
All ocean lived within a wandering drop,<br>
A time-made body housed the Illimitable.<br>
To live this Mystery out our souls came here.<br>
A Seer within who knows the ordered plan<br>
Concealed behind our momentary steps,<br>
Inspires our ascent to viewless heights<br>
As once the abysmal leap to earth and life.<br>
His call had reached the Traveller in Time.<br>
Apart in an unfathomed loneliness,<br>
He travelled in his mute and single strength<br>

Bearing the burden of the world’s desire.<br>
A formless Stillness called, a nameless Light.<br>
Above him was the white immobile Ray,<br>
Around him the eternal Silences.<br>
No term was fixed to the high-pitched attempt;<br>
World after world disclosed its guarded powers,<br>
Heaven after heaven its deep beatitudes,<br>
But still the invisible Magnet drew his soul.<br>
A figure sole on Nature’s giant stair,<br>
He mounted towards an indiscernible end<br>
On the bare summit of created things.<br>

The Kingdom of Subtle Matter<br>
IN THE impalpable field of secret self,<br>
This little outer being’s vast support<br>
Parted from vision by earth’s solid fence,<br>
He came into a magic crystal air<br>
And found a life that lived not by the flesh,<br>
A light that made visible immaterial things.<br>
A fine degree in wonder’s hierarchy,<br>
The kingdom of subtle Matter’s faery craft<br>
Outlined against a sky of vivid hues,<br>
Leaping out of a splendour-trance and haze,<br>
The wizard revelation of its front.<br>
A world of lovelier forms lies near to ours,<br>
Where, undisguised by earth’s deforming sight,<br>
All shapes are beautiful and all things true.<br>
In that lucent ambience mystically clear<br>
The eyes were doors to a celestial sense,<br>
Hearing was music and the touch a charm,<br>
And the heart drew a deeper breath of power.<br>
There dwell earth-nature’s shining origins:<br>
The perfect plans on which she moulds her works,<br>
The distant outcomes of her travailing force,<br>
Repose in a framework of established fate.<br>
Attempted vainly now or won in vain,<br>
Already were mapped and scheduled there the time<br>
And figure of her future sovereignties<br>
In the sumptuous lineaments traced by desire.<br>
The golden issue of mind’s labyrinth plots,<br>
The riches unfound or still uncaught by our lives,<br>
Unsullied by the attaint of mortal thought<br>
Abide in that pellucid atmosphere.<br>
Our vague beginnings are overtaken there,<br>

Our middle terms sketched out in prescient lines,<br>
Our finished ends anticipated live.<br>
This brilliant roof of our descending plane,<br>
Intercepting the free boon of heaven’s air,<br>
Admits small inrushes of a mighty breath<br>
Or fragrant circuits through gold lattices;<br>
It shields our ceiling of terrestrial mind<br>
From deathless suns and the streaming of God’s rain,<br>
Yet canalises a strange irised glow,<br>
And bright dews drip from the Immortal’s sky.<br>
A passage for the Powers that move our days,<br>
Occult behind this grosser Nature’s walls,<br>
A gossamer marriage-hall of Mind with Form<br>
Is hidden by a tapestry of dreams;<br>
Heaven’s meanings steal through it as through a veil,<br>
Its inner sight sustains this outer scene.<br>
A finer consciousness with happier lines,<br>
It has a tact our touch cannot attain,<br>
A purity of sense we never feel;<br>
Its intercession with the eternal Ray<br>
Inspires our transient earth’s brief-lived attempts<br>
At beauty and the perfect shape of things.<br>
In rooms of the young divinity of power<br>
And early play of the eternal Child<br>
The embodiments of his outwinging thoughts<br>
Laved in a bright everlasting wonder’s tints<br>
And lulled by whispers of that lucid air<br>
Take dream-hued rest like birds on timeless trees<br>
Before they dive to float on earth-time’s sea.<br>
All that here seems has lovelier semblance there.<br>
Whatever our hearts conceive, our heads create,<br>
Some high original beauty forfeiting,<br>
Thence exiled here consents to an earthly tinge.<br>
Whatever is here of visible charm and grace<br>
Finds there its faultless and immortal lines;<br>
All that is beautiful here is there divine.<br>

Figures are there undreamed by mortal mind:<br>
Bodies that have no earthly counterpart<br>
Traverse the inner eye’s illumined trance<br>
And ravish the heart with their celestial tread<br>
Persuading heaven to inhabit that wonder sphere.<br>
The future’s marvels wander in its gulfs;<br>
Things old and new are fashioned in those depths:<br>
A carnival of beauty crowds the heights<br>
In that magic kingdom of ideal sight.<br>
In its antechambers of splendid privacy<br>
Matter and soul in conscious union meet<br>
Like lovers in a lonely secret place:<br>
In the clasp of a passion not yet unfortunate<br>
They join their strength and sweetness and delight<br>
And mingling make the high and low worlds one.<br>
Intruder from the formless Infinite<br>
Daring to break into the Inconscient’s reign,<br>
The spirit’s leap towards body touches ground.<br>
As yet unwrapped in earthly lineaments,<br>
Already it wears outlasting death and birth,<br>
Convincing the abyss by heavenly form,<br>
A covering of its immortality<br>
Alive to the lustre of the wearer’s rank,<br>
Fit to endure the rub of Change and Time.<br>
A tissue mixed of the soul’s radiant light<br>
And Matter’s substance of sign-burdened Force, —<br>
Imagined vainly in our mind’s thin air<br>
An abstract phantasm mould of mental make, —<br>
It feels what earthly bodies cannot feel<br>
And is more real than this grosser frame.<br>
After the falling of mortality’s cloak<br>
Lightened is its weight to heighten its ascent;<br>
Refined to the touch of finer environments<br>
It drops old patterned palls of denser stuff,<br>
Cancels the grip of earth’s descending pull<br>
And bears the soul from world to higher world,<br>

Till in the naked ether of the peaks<br>
The spirit’s simplicity alone is left,<br>
The eternal being’s first transparent robe.<br>
But when it must come back to its mortal load<br>
And the hard ensemble of earth’s experience,<br>
Then its return resumes that heavier dress.<br>
For long before earth’s solid vest was forged<br>
By the technique of the atomic Void,<br>
A lucent envelope of self-disguise<br>
Was woven round the secret spirit in things.<br>
The subtle realms from those bright sheaths are made.<br>
This wonder-world with all its radiant boon<br>
Of vision and inviolate happiness,<br>
Only for expression cares and perfect form;<br>
Fair on its peaks, it has dangerous nether planes;<br>
Its light draws towards the verge of Nature’s lapse;<br>
It lends beauty to the terror of the gulfs<br>
And fascinating eyes to perilous Gods,<br>
Invests with grace the demon and the snake.<br>
Its trance imposes earth’s inconscience,<br>
Immortal it weaves for us death’s sombre robe<br>
And authorises our mortality.<br>
This medium serves a greater Consciousness:<br>
A vessel of its concealed autocracy,<br>
It is the subtle ground of Matter’s worlds,<br>
It is the immutable in their mutable forms,<br>
In the folds of its creative memory<br>
It guards the deathless type of perishing things:<br>
Its lowered potencies found our fallen strengths;<br>
Its thought invents our reasoned ignorance;<br>
Its sense fathers our body’s reflexes.<br>
Our secret breath of untried mightier force,<br>
The lurking sun of an instant’s inner sight,<br>
Its fine suggestions are a covert fount<br>
For our iridescent rich imaginings<br>
Touching things common with transfiguring hues<br>

And a glory gleams from the soul’s decadence.<br>

Its beauty dons our mud-mask ugliness,<br>
Its artist good begins our evil’s tale.<br>
A heaven of creative truths above,<br>
A cosmos of harmonious dreams between,<br>
A chaos of dissolving forms below,<br>
It plunges lost in our inconscient base.<br>
Out of its fall our denser Matter came.<br>
Thus taken was God’s plunge into the Night.<br>
This fallen world became a nurse of souls<br>
Inhabited by concealed divinity.<br>
A Being woke and lived in the meaningless void,<br>
A world-wide Nescience strove towards life and thought,<br>
A Consciousness plucked out from mindless sleep.<br>
All here is driven by an insentient will.<br>
Thus fallen, inconscient, frustrate, dense, inert,<br>
Sunk into inanimate and torpid drowse<br>
Earth lay, a drudge of sleep, forced to create<br>
By a subconscient yearning memory<br>
Left from a happiness dead before she was born,<br>
An alien wonder on her senseless breast.<br>
This mire must harbour the orchid and the rose,<br>
From her blind unwilling substance must emerge<br>
A beauty that belongs to happier spheres.<br>
This is the destiny bequeathed to her,<br>
As if a slain god left a golden trust<br>
To a blind force and an imprisoned soul.<br>
An immortal godhead’s perishable parts<br>
She must reconstitute from fragments lost,<br>
Reword from a document complete elsewhere<br>
Her doubtful title to her divine Name.<br>
A residue her sole inheritance,<br>
All things she carries in her shapeless dust.<br>

Her giant energy tied to petty forms<br>
In the slow tentative motion of her power<br>
With only frail blunt instruments for use,<br>
She has accepted as her nature’s need<br>
And given to man as his stupendous work<br>
A labour to the gods impossible.<br>
A life living hardly in a field of death<br>
Its portion claims of immortality;<br>
A brute half-conscious body serves as means<br>
A mind that must recover a knowledge lost<br>
Held in stone grip by the world’s inconscience,<br>
And wearing still these countless knots of Law<br>
A spirit bound stand up as Nature’s king.<br>
A mighty kinship is this daring’s cause.<br>
All we attempt in this imperfect world,<br>
Looks forward or looks back beyond Time’s gloss<br>
To its pure idea and firm inviolate type<br>
In an absolute creation’s flawless skill.<br>
To seize the absolute in shapes that pass,<br>
To fix the eternal’s touch in time-made things,<br>
This is the law of all perfection here.<br>
A fragment here is caught of heaven’s design;<br>
Else could we never hope for greater life<br>
And ecstasy and glory could not be.<br>
Even in the littleness of our mortal state,<br>
Even in this prison-house of outer form,<br>
A brilliant passage for the infallible Flame<br>
Is driven through gross walls of nerve and brain,<br>
A Splendour presses or a Power breaks through,<br>
Earth’s great dull barrier is removed awhile,<br>
The inconscient seal is lifted from our eyes<br>
And we grow vessels of creative might.<br>

Pervades our life, a mystic stir is felt,<br>

Intimations cast from the Invisible<br>
Awaking from Infinity’s sleep come down,<br>
Symbols of That which never yet was made.<br>
But soon the inert flesh responds no more,<br>
Then sinks the sacred orgy of delight,<br>
The blaze of passion and the tide of power<br>
Are taken from us and, though a glowing form<br>
Abides astonishing earth, imagined supreme,<br>
Too little of what was meant has left a trace.<br>
Earth’s eyes half-see, her forces half-create;<br>
Her rarest works are copies of heaven’s art.<br>
A radiance of a golden artifice,<br>
A masterpiece of inspired device and rule,<br>
Her forms hide what they house and only mime<br>
The unseized miracle of self-born shapes<br>
That live for ever in the Eternal’s gaze.<br>
Here in a difficult half-finished world<br>
Is a slow toiling of unconscious Powers;<br>
Here is man’s ignorant divining mind,<br>
His genius born from an inconscient soil.<br>
To copy on earth’s copies is his art.<br>
For when he strives for things surpassing earth,<br>
Too rude the workman’s tools, too crude his stuff,<br>
And hardly with his heart’s blood he achieves<br>
His transient house of the divine Idea,<br>
His figure of a Time-inn for the Unborn.<br>

And would bring down their dateless meanings here,<br>
But, too divine for earthly Nature’s scheme,<br>
Beyond our reach the eternal marvels blaze.<br>

Immaculate in the Spirit’s deathless air,<br>
Immortal in a world of motionless Time<br>
And an unchanging muse of deep self-space.<br>

And joins us to the timeless and the true;<br>
It brings to us the inevitable word,<br>
The godlike act, the thoughts that never die.<br>
A ripple of light and glory wraps the brain,<br>
And travelling down the moment’s vanishing route<br>
The figures of eternity arrive.<br>
As the mind’s visitors or the heart’s guests<br>
They espouse our mortal brevity awhile,<br>
Or seldom in some rare delivering glimpse<br>
Are caught by our vision’s delicate surmise.<br>
Although beginnings only and first attempts,<br>
These glimmerings point to the secret of our birth<br>
And the hidden miracle of our destiny.<br>
What we are there and here on earth shall be<br>
Is imaged in a contact and a call.<br>
As yet earth’s imperfection is our sphere,<br>
Our nature’s glass shows not our real self;<br>
That greatness still abides held back within.<br>
Earth’s doubting future hides our heritage:<br>
The Light now distant shall grow native here,<br>
The Strength that visits us our comrade power;<br>
The Ineffable shall find a secret voice,<br>

The Spirit holds up its mirrored self and works,<br>
The power and passion of its timeless heart,<br>
The figures of its formless ecstasy,<br>
The grandeurs of its multitudinous might.<br>
Thence comes the mystic substance of our souls<br>
Into the prodigy of our nature’s birth,<br>
There is the unfallen height of all we are<br>
And dateless fount of all we hope to be.<br>
On every plane the hieratic Power,<br>
Initiate of unspoken verities,<br>
Dreams to transcribe and make a part of life<br>
In its own native style and living tongue<br>
Some trait of the perfection of the Unborn,<br>
Some vision seen in the omniscient Light,<br>
Some far tone of the immortal rhapsodist Voice,<br>
Some rapture of the all-creating Bliss,<br>
Some form and plan of the Beauty unutterable.<br>
Worlds are there nearer to those absolute realms,<br>
Where the response to Truth is swift and sure<br>
And spirit is not hampered by its frame<br>
And hearts by sharp division seized and rent<br>
And delight and beauty are inhabitants<br>
And love and sweetness are the law of life.<br>
A finer substance in a subtler mould<br>
Embodies the divinity earth but dreams;<br>
Its strength can overtake joy’s running feet;<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Overleaping the fixed hurdles set by Time,<br>
The rapid net of an intuitive clasp<br>
Captures the fugitive happiness we desire.<br>
A Nature lifted by a larger breath,<br>
Plastic and passive to the all-shaping Fire,<br>
Answers the flaming Godhead’s casual touch:<br>
Immune from our inertia of response<br>
It hears the word to which our hearts are deaf,<br>
Adopts the seeing of immortal eyes<br>
And, traveller on the roads of line and hue,<br>
Pursues the spirit of beauty to its home.<br>
Thus we draw near to the All-Wonderful<br>
Following his rapture in things as sign and guide;<br>
Beauty is his footprint showing us where he has passed,<br>
Love is his heart-beats’ rhythm in mortal breasts,<br>
Happiness the smile on his adorable face.<br>
A communion of spiritual entities,<br>
A genius of creative Immanence,<br>
Makes all creation deeply intimate:<br>
A fourth dimension of aesthetic sense<br>
Where all is in ourselves, ourselves in all,<br>
To the cosmic wideness re-aligns our souls.<br>
A kindling rapture joins the seer and seen;<br>
The craftsman and the craft grown inly one<br>
Achieve perfection by the magic throb<br>
And passion of their close identity.<br>
All that we slowly piece from gathered parts,<br>
Or by long labour stumblingly evolve,<br>
Is there self-born by its eternal right.<br>
In us too the intuitive Fire can burn;<br>
An agent Light, it is coiled in our folded hearts,<br>
On the celestial levels is its home:<br>
Descending, it can bring those heavens here.<br>
But rarely burns the flame nor burns for long;<br>
The joy it calls from those diviner heights<br>
Brings brief magnificent reminiscences<br>
<br>
112<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Kingdom of Subtle Matter<br>
<br>
And high splendid glimpses of interpreting thought,<br>
But not the utter vision and delight.<br>
A veil is kept, something is still held back,<br>
Lest, captives of the beauty and the joy,<br>
Our souls forget to the Highest to aspire.<br>
In that fair subtle realm behind our own<br>
The form is all, and physical gods are kings.<br>
The inspiring Light plays in fine boundaries;<br>
A faultless beauty comes by Nature’s grace;<br>
There liberty is perfection’s guarantee:<br>
Although the absolute Image lacks, the Word<br>
Incarnate, the sheer spiritual ecstasy,<br>
All is a miracle of symmetric charm,<br>
A fantasy of perfect line and rule.<br>
There all feel satisfied in themselves and whole,<br>
A rich completeness is by limit made,<br>
Marvel in an utter littleness abounds,<br>
An intricate rapture riots in a small space:<br>
Each rhythm is kin to its environment,<br>
Each line is perfect and inevitable,<br>
Each object faultlessly built for charm and use.<br>
All is enamoured of its own delight.<br>
Intact it lives of its perfection sure<br>
In a heaven-pleased self-glad immunity;<br>
Content to be, it has need of nothing more.<br>
Here was not futile effort’s broken heart:<br>
Exempt from the ordeal and the test,<br>
Empty of opposition and of pain,<br>
It was a world that could not fear nor grieve.<br>
It had no grace of error or defeat,<br>
It had no room for fault, no power to fail.<br>
Out of some packed self-bliss it drew at once<br>
Its form-discoveries of the mute Idea<br>
And the miracle of its rhythmic thoughts and acts,<br>
Its clear technique of firm and rounded lives,<br>
<br>
113<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Its gracious people of inanimate shapes<br>
And glory of breathing bodies like our own.<br>
Amazed, his senses ravished with delight,<br>
He moved in a divine, yet kindred world<br>
Admiring marvellous forms so near to ours<br>
Yet perfect like the playthings of a god,<br>
Deathless in the aspect of mortality.<br>
In their narrow and exclusive absolutes<br>
The finite’s ranked supremacies throned abide;<br>
It dreams not ever of what might have been;<br>
Only in boundaries can this absolute live.<br>
In a supremeness bound to its own plan<br>
Where all was finished and no widths were left,<br>
No space for shadows of the immeasurable,<br>
No room for the incalculable’s surprise,<br>
A captive of its own beauty and ecstasy,<br>
In a magic circle wrought the enchanted Might.<br>
The spirit stood back effaced behind its frame.<br>
Admired for the bright finality of its lines<br>
A blue horizon limited the soul;<br>
Thought moved in luminous facilities,<br>
The outer ideal’s shallows its swim-range:<br>
Life in its boundaries lingered satisfied<br>
With the small happiness of the body’s acts.<br>
Assigned as Force to a bound corner-Mind,<br>
Attached to the safe paucity of her room,<br>
She did her little works and played and slept<br>
And thought not of a greater work undone.<br>
Forgetful of her violent vast desires,<br>
Forgetful of the heights to which she rose,<br>
Her walk was fixed within a radiant groove.<br>
The beautiful body of a soul at ease,<br>
Like one who laughs in sweet and sunlit groves,<br>
Childlike she swung in her gold cradle of joy.<br>
The spaces’ call reached not her charmed abode,<br>
She had no wings for wide and dangerous flight,<br>
<br>
114<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Kingdom of Subtle Matter<br>
<br>
115<br>
<br>
She faced no peril of sky or of abyss,<br>
She knew no vistas and no mighty dreams,<br>
No yearning for her lost infinitudes.<br>
A perfect picture in a perfect frame,<br>
This faery artistry could not keep his will:<br>
Only a moment’s fine release it gave;<br>
A careless hour was spent in a slight bliss.<br>
Our spirit tires of being’s surfaces,<br>
Transcended is the splendour of the form;<br>
It turns to hidden powers and deeper states.<br>
So now he looked beyond for greater light.<br>
His soul’s peak-climb abandoning in its rear<br>
This brilliant courtyard of the House of Days,<br>
He left that fine material Paradise.<br>
His destiny lay beyond in larger Space.<br>
END OF CANTO TWO<br>
<br>
Canto Three<br>
<br>
The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
AN UNEVEN broad ascent now lured his feet.<br>
Answering a greater Nature’s troubled call<br>
He crossed the limits of embodied Mind<br>
And entered wide obscure disputed fields<br>
Where all was doubt and change and nothing sure,<br>
A world of search and toil without repose.<br>
As one who meets the face of the Unknown,<br>
A questioner with none to give reply,<br>
Attracted to a problem never solved,<br>
Always uncertain of the ground he trod,<br>
Always drawn on to an inconstant goal<br>
He travelled through a land peopled by doubts<br>
In shifting confines on a quaking base.<br>
In front he saw a boundary ever unreached<br>
And thought himself at each step nearer now, —<br>
A far retreating horizon of mirage.<br>
A vagrancy was there that brooked no home,<br>
A journey of countless paths without a close.<br>
Nothing he found to satisfy his heart;<br>
A tireless wandering sought and could not cease.<br>
There life is the manifest Incalculable,<br>
A movement of unquiet seas, a long<br>
And venturous leap of spirit into Space,<br>
A vexed disturbance in the eternal Calm,<br>
An impulse and passion of the Infinite.<br>
Assuming whatever shape her fancy wills,<br>
Escaped from the restraint of settled forms<br>
She has left the safety of the tried and known.<br>
Unshepherded by the fear that walks through Time,<br>
Undaunted by Fate that dogs and Chance that springs,<br>
She accepts disaster as a common risk;<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
Careless of suffering, heedless of sin and fall,<br>
She wrestles with danger and discovery<br>
In the unexplored expanses of the soul.<br>
To be seemed only a long experiment,<br>
The hazard of a seeking ignorant Force<br>
That tries all truths and, finding none supreme,<br>
Moves on unsatisfied, unsure of its end.<br>
As saw some inner mind, so life was shaped:<br>
From thought to thought she passed, from phase to phase,<br>
Tortured by her own powers or proud and blest,<br>
Now master of herself, now toy and slave.<br>
A huge inconsequence was her action’s law,<br>
As if all possibility must be drained,<br>
And anguish and bliss were pastimes of the heart.<br>
In a gallop of thunder-hooved vicissitudes<br>
She swept through the race-fields of Circumstance,<br>
Or, swaying, she tossed between her heights and deeps,<br>
Uplifted or broken on Time’s inconstant wheel.<br>
Amid a tedious crawl of drab desires<br>
She writhed, a worm mid worms in Nature’s mud,<br>
Then, Titan-statured, took all earth for food,<br>
Ambitioned the seas for robe, for crown the stars<br>
And shouting strode from peak to giant peak,<br>
Clamouring for worlds to conquer and to rule.<br>
Then, wantonly enamoured of Sorrow’s face,<br>
She plunged into the anguish of the depths<br>
And, wallowing, clung to her own misery.<br>
In dolorous converse with her squandered self<br>
She wrote the account of all that she had lost,<br>
Or sat with grief as with an ancient friend.<br>
A romp of violent raptures soon was spent,<br>
Or she lingered tied to an inadequate joy<br>
Missing the turns of fate, missing life’s goal.<br>
A scene was planned for all her numberless moods<br>
Where each could be the law and way of life,<br>
But none could offer a pure felicity;<br>
<br>
117<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
118<br>
<br>
Only a flickering zest they left behind<br>
Or the fierce lust that brings a dead fatigue.<br>
Amid her swift untold variety<br>
Something remained dissatisfied, ever the same<br>
And in the new saw only a face of the old,<br>
For every hour repeated all the rest<br>
And every change prolonged the same unease.<br>
A spirit of her self and aim unsure,<br>
Tired soon of too much joy and happiness,<br>
She needs the spur of pleasure and of pain<br>
And the native taste of suffering and unrest:<br>
She strains for an end that never can she win.<br>
A perverse savour haunts her thirsting lips:<br>
For the grief she weeps which came from her own choice,<br>
For the pleasure yearns that racked with wounds her breast;<br>
Aspiring to heaven she turns her steps towards hell.<br>
Chance she has chosen and danger for playfellows;<br>
Fate’s dreadful swing she has taken for cradle and seat.<br>
Yet pure and bright from the Timeless was her birth,<br>
A lost world-rapture lingers in her eyes,<br>
Her moods are faces of the Infinite:<br>
Beauty and happiness are her native right,<br>
And endless Bliss is her eternal home.<br>
This now revealed its antique face of joy,<br>
A sudden disclosure to the heart of grief<br>
Tempting it to endure and long and hope.<br>
Even in changing worlds bereft of peace,<br>
In an air racked with sorrow and with fear<br>
And while his feet trod on a soil unsafe,<br>
He saw the image of a happier state.<br>
In an architecture of hieratic Space<br>
Circling and mounting towards creation’s tops,<br>
At a blue height which never was too high<br>
For warm communion between body and soul,<br>
As far as heaven, as near as thought and hope,<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
Glimmered the kingdom of a griefless life.<br>
Above him in a new celestial vault<br>
Other than the heavens beheld by mortal eyes,<br>
As on a fretted ceiling of the gods,<br>
An archipelago of laughter and fire,<br>
Swam stars apart in a rippled sea of sky.<br>
Towered spirals, magic rings of vivid hue<br>
And gleaming spheres of strange felicity<br>
Floated through distance like a symbol world.<br>
On the trouble and the toil they could not share,<br>
On the unhappiness they could not aid,<br>
Impervious to life’s suffering, struggle, grief,<br>
Untarnished by its anger, gloom and hate,<br>
Unmoved, untouched, looked down great visioned planes<br>
Blissful for ever in their timeless right.<br>
Absorbed in their own beauty and content,<br>
Of their immortal gladness they live sure.<br>
Apart in their self-glory plunged, remote<br>
Burning they swam in a vague lucent haze,<br>
An everlasting refuge of dream-light,<br>
A nebula of the splendours of the gods<br>
Made from the musings of eternity.<br>
Almost unbelievable by human faith,<br>
Hardly they seemed the stuff of things that are.<br>
As through a magic television’s glass<br>
Outlined to some magnifying inner eye<br>
They shone like images thrown from a far scene<br>
Too high and glad for mortal lids to seize.<br>
But near and real to the longing heart<br>
And to the body’s passionate thought and sense<br>
Are the hidden kingdoms of beatitude.<br>
In some close unattained realm which yet we feel,<br>
Immune from the harsh clutch of Death and Time,<br>
Escaping the search of sorrow and desire,<br>
In bright enchanted safe peripheries<br>
For ever wallowing in bliss they lie.<br>
<br>
119<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
120<br>
<br>
In dream and trance and muse before our eyes,<br>
Across a subtle vision’s inner field,<br>
Wide rapturous landscapes fleeting from the sight,<br>
The figures of the perfect kingdom pass<br>
And behind them leave a shining memory’s trail.<br>
Imagined scenes or great eternal worlds,<br>
Dream-caught or sensed, they touch our hearts with their depths;<br>
Unreal-seeming, yet more real than life,<br>
Happier than happiness, truer than things true,<br>
If dreams these were or captured images,<br>
Dream’s truth made false earth’s vain realities.<br>
In a swift eternal moment fixed there live<br>
Or ever recalled come back to longing eyes<br>
Calm heavens of imperishable Light,<br>
Illumined continents of violet peace,<br>
Oceans and rivers of the mirth of God<br>
And griefless countries under purple suns.<br>
This, once a star of bright remote idea<br>
Or imagination’s comet trail of dream,<br>
Took now a close shape of reality.<br>
The gulf between dream-truth, earth-fact was crossed,<br>
The wonder-worlds of life were dreams no more;<br>
His vision made all they unveiled its own:<br>
Their scenes, their happenings met his eyes and heart<br>
And smote them with pure loveliness and bliss.<br>
A breathless summit region drew his gaze<br>
Whose boundaries jutted into a sky of Self<br>
And dipped towards a strange ethereal base.<br>
The quintessence glowed of Life’s supreme delight.<br>
On a spiritual and mysterious peak<br>
Only a miracle’s high transfiguring line<br>
Divided life from the formless Infinite<br>
And sheltered Time against eternity.<br>
Out of that formless stuff Time mints his shapes;<br>
The Eternal’s quiet holds the cosmic act:<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
The protean images of the World-Force<br>
Have drawn the strength to be, the will to last<br>
From a deep ocean of dynamic peace.<br>
Inverting the spirit’s apex towards life,<br>
She spends the plastic liberties of the One<br>
To cast in acts the dreams of her caprice,<br>
His wisdom’s call steadies her careless feet,<br>
He props her dance upon a rigid base,<br>
His timeless still immutability<br>
Must standardise her creation’s miracle.<br>
Out of the Void’s unseeing energies<br>
Inventing the scene of a concrete universe,<br>
By his thought she has fixed its paces, in its blind acts<br>
She sees by flashes of his all-knowing Light.<br>
At her will the inscrutable Supermind leans down<br>
To guide her force that feels but cannot know,<br>
Its breath of power controls her restless seas<br>
And life obeys the governing Idea.<br>
At her will, led by a luminous Immanence<br>
The hazardous experimenting Mind<br>
Pushes its way through obscure possibles<br>
Mid chance formations of an unknowing world.<br>
Our human ignorance moves towards the Truth<br>
That Nescience may become omniscient,<br>
Transmuted instincts shape to divine thoughts,<br>
Thoughts house infallible immortal sight<br>
And Nature climb towards God’s identity.<br>
The Master of the worlds self-made her slave<br>
Is the executor of her fantasies:<br>
She has canalised the seas of omnipotence;<br>
She has limited by her laws the Illimitable.<br>
The Immortal bound himself to do her works;<br>
He labours at the tasks her Ignorance sets,<br>
Hidden in the cape of our mortality.<br>
The worlds, the forms her goddess fancy makes<br>
Have lost their origin on unseen heights:<br>
<br>
121<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Even severed, straying from their timeless source,<br>
Even deformed, obscure, accursed and fallen, —<br>
Since even fall has its perverted joy<br>
And nothing she leaves out that serves delight, —<br>
These too can to the peaks revert or here<br>
Cut out the sentence of the spirit’s fall,<br>
Recover their forfeited divinity.<br>
At once caught in an eternal vision’s sweep<br>
He saw her pride and splendour of highborn zones<br>
And her regions crouching in the nether deeps.<br>
Above was a monarchy of unfallen self,<br>
Beneath was the gloomy trance of the abyss,<br>
An opposite pole or dim antipodes.<br>
There were vasts of the glory of life’s absolutes:<br>
All laughed in a safe immortality<br>
And an eternal childhood of the soul<br>
Before darkness came and pain and grief were born<br>
Where all could dare to be themselves and one<br>
And Wisdom played in sinless innocence<br>
With naked Freedom in Truth’s happy sun.<br>
There were worlds of her laughter and dreadful irony,<br>
There were fields of her taste of toil and strife and tears;<br>
Her head lay on the breast of amorous Death,<br>
Sleep imitated awhile extinction’s peace.<br>
The light of God she has parted from his dark<br>
To test the savour of bare opposites.<br>
Here mingling in man’s heart their tones and hues<br>
Have woven his being’s mutable design,<br>
His life a forward-rippling stream in Time,<br>
His nature’s constant fixed mobility,<br>
His soul a moving picture’s changeful film,<br>
His cosmos-chaos of personality.<br>
The grand creatrix with her cryptic touch<br>
Has turned to pathos and power being’s self-dream,<br>
Made a passion-play of its fathomless mystery.<br>
<br>
122<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
But here were worlds lifted half-way to heaven.<br>
The Veil was there but not the Shadowy Wall;<br>
In forms not too remote from human grasp<br>
Some passion of the inviolate purity<br>
Broke through, a ray of the original Bliss.<br>
Heaven’s joys might have been earth’s if earth were pure.<br>
There could have reached our divinised sense and heart<br>
Some natural felicity’s bright extreme,<br>
Some thrill of Supernature’s absolutes:<br>
All strengths could laugh and sport on earth’s hard roads<br>
And never feel her cruel edge of pain,<br>
All love could play and nowhere Nature’s shame.<br>
But she has stabled her dreams in Matter’s courts<br>
And still her doors are barred to things supreme.<br>
These worlds could feel God’s breath visiting their tops;<br>
Some glimmer of the Transcendent’s hem was there.<br>
Across the white aeonic silences<br>
Immortal figures of embodied joy<br>
Traversed wide spaces near to eternity’s sleep.<br>
Pure mystic voices in beatitude’s hush<br>
Appealed to Love’s immaculate sweetnesses,<br>
Calling his honeyed touch to thrill the worlds,<br>
His blissful hands to seize on Nature’s limbs,<br>
His sweet intolerant might of union<br>
To take all beings into his saviour arms,<br>
Drawing to his pity the rebel and the waif<br>
To force on them the happiness they refuse.<br>
A chant hymeneal to the unseen Divine,<br>
A flaming rhapsody of white desire<br>
Lured an immortal music into the heart<br>
And woke the slumbering ear of ecstasy.<br>
A purer, fierier sense had there its home,<br>
A burning urge no earthly limbs can hold;<br>
One drew a large unburdened spacious breath<br>
And the heart sped from beat to rapturous beat.<br>
The voice of Time sang of the Immortal’s joy;<br>
<br>
123<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
An inspiration and a lyric cry,<br>
The moments came with ecstasy on their wings;<br>
Beauty unimaginable moved heaven-bare<br>
Absolved from boundaries in the vasts of dream;<br>
The cry of the Birds of Wonder called from the skies<br>
To the deathless people of the shores of Light.<br>
Creation leaped straight from the hands of God;<br>
Marvel and rapture wandered in the ways.<br>
Only to be was a supreme delight,<br>
Life was a happy laughter of the soul<br>
And Joy was king with Love for minister.<br>
The spirit’s luminousness was bodied there.<br>
Life’s contraries were lovers or natural friends<br>
And her extremes keen edges of harmony:<br>
Indulgence with a tender purity came<br>
And nursed the god on her maternal breast:<br>
There none was weak, so falsehood could not live;<br>
Ignorance was a thin shade protecting light,<br>
Imagination the free-will of Truth,<br>
Pleasure a candidate for heaven’s fire;<br>
The intellect was Beauty’s worshipper,<br>
Strength was the slave of calm spiritual law,<br>
Power laid its head upon the breasts of Bliss.<br>
There were summit-glories inconceivable,<br>
Autonomies of Wisdom’s still self-rule<br>
And high dependencies of her virgin sun,<br>
Illumined theocracies of the seeing soul<br>
Throned in the power of the Transcendent’s ray.<br>
A vision of grandeurs, a dream of magnitudes<br>
In sun-bright kingdoms moved with regal gait:<br>
Assemblies, crowded senates of the gods,<br>
Life’s puissances reigned on seats of marble will,<br>
High dominations and autocracies<br>
And laurelled strengths and armed imperative mights.<br>
All objects there were great and beautiful,<br>
All beings wore a royal stamp of power.<br>
<br>
124<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
There sat the oligarchies of natural Law,<br>
Proud violent heads served one calm monarch brow:<br>
All the soul’s postures donned divinity.<br>
There met the ardent mutual intimacies<br>
Of mastery’s joy and the joy of servitude<br>
Imposed by Love on Love’s heart that obeys<br>
And Love’s body held beneath a rapturous yoke.<br>
All was a game of meeting kinglinesses.<br>
For worship lifts the worshipper’s bowed strength<br>
Close to the god’s pride and bliss his soul adores:<br>
The ruler there is one with all he rules;<br>
To him who serves with a free equal heart<br>
Obedience is his princely training’s school,<br>
His nobility’s coronet and privilege,<br>
His faith is a high nature’s idiom,<br>
His service a spiritual sovereignty.<br>
There were realms where Knowledge joined creative Power<br>
In her high home and made her all his own:<br>
The grand Illuminate seized her gleaming limbs<br>
And filled them with the passion of his ray<br>
Till all her body was its transparent house<br>
And all her soul a counterpart of his soul.<br>
Apotheosised, transfigured by wisdom’s touch,<br>
Her days became a luminous sacrifice;<br>
An immortal moth in happy and endless fire,<br>
She burned in his sweet intolerable blaze.<br>
A captive Life wedded her conqueror.<br>
In his wide sky she built her world anew;<br>
She gave to mind’s calm pace the motor’s speed,<br>
To thinking a need to live what the soul saw,<br>
To living an impetus to know and see.<br>
His splendour grasped her, her puissance to him clung;<br>
She crowned the Idea a king in purple robes,<br>
Put her magic serpent sceptre in Thought’s grip,<br>
Made forms his inward vision’s rhythmic shapes<br>
And her acts the living body of his will.<br>
<br>
125<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
A flaming thunder, a creator flash,<br>
His victor Light rode on her deathless Force;<br>
A centaur’s mighty gallop bore the god.<br>
Life throned with mind, a double majesty.<br>
Worlds were there of a happiness great and grave<br>
And action tinged with dream, laughter with thought,<br>
And passion there could wait for its desire<br>
Until it heard the near approach of God.<br>
Worlds were there of a childlike mirth and joy;<br>
A carefree youthfulness of mind and heart<br>
Found in the body a heavenly instrument;<br>
It lit an aureate halo round desire<br>
And freed the deified animal in the limbs<br>
To divine gambols of love and beauty and bliss.<br>
On a radiant soil that gazed at heaven’s smile<br>
A swift life-impulse stinted not nor stopped:<br>
It knew not how to tire; happy were its tears.<br>
There work was play and play the only work,<br>
The tasks of heaven a game of godlike might:<br>
A celestial bacchanal for ever pure,<br>
Unstayed by faintness as in mortal frames<br>
Life was an eternity of rapture’s moods:<br>
Age never came, care never lined the face.<br>
Imposing on the safety of the stars<br>
A race and laughter of immortal strengths,<br>
The nude god-children in their play-fields ran<br>
Smiting the winds with splendour and with speed;<br>
Of storm and sun they made companions,<br>
Sported with the white mane of tossing seas,<br>
Slew distance trampled to death under their wheels<br>
And wrestled in the arenas of their force.<br>
Imperious in their radiance like the suns<br>
They kindled heaven with the glory of their limbs<br>
Flung like a divine largess to the world.<br>
A spell to force the heart to stark delight,<br>
They carried the pride and mastery of their charm<br>
<br>
126<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
As if Life’s banner on the roads of Space.<br>
Ideas were luminous comrades of the soul;<br>
Mind played with speech, cast javelins of thought,<br>
But needed not these instruments’ toil to know;<br>
Knowledge was Nature’s pastime like the rest.<br>
Investitured with the fresh heart’s bright ray,<br>
An early God-instinct’s child inheritors,<br>
Tenants of the perpetuity of Time<br>
Still thrilling with the first creation’s bliss,<br>
They steeped existence in their youth of soul.<br>
An exquisite and vehement tyranny,<br>
The strong compulsion of their will to joy<br>
Poured smiling streams of happiness through the world.<br>
There reigned a breath of high immune content,<br>
A fortunate gait of days in tranquil air,<br>
A flood of universal love and peace.<br>
A sovereignty of tireless sweetness lived<br>
Like a song of pleasure on the lips of Time.<br>
A large spontaneous order freed the will,<br>
A sun-frank winging of the soul to bliss,<br>
The breadth and greatness of the unfettered act<br>
And the swift fire-heart’s golden liberty.<br>
There was no falsehood of soul-severance,<br>
There came no crookedness of thought or word<br>
To rob creation of its native truth;<br>
All was sincerity and natural force.<br>
There freedom was sole rule and highest law.<br>
In a happy series climbed or plunged these worlds:<br>
In realms of curious beauty and surprise,<br>
In fields of grandeur and of titan power,<br>
Life played at ease with her immense desires.<br>
A thousand Edens she could build nor pause;<br>
No bound was set to her greatness and to her grace<br>
And to her heavenly variety.<br>
Awake with a cry and stir of numberless souls,<br>
Arisen from the breast of some deep Infinite,<br>

<br>
Smiling like a new-born child at love and hope,<br>
In her nature housing the Immortal’s power,<br>
In her bosom bearing the eternal Will,<br>
No guide she needed but her luminous heart:<br>
No fall debased the godhead of her steps,<br>
No alien Night had come to blind her eyes.<br>
There was no use for grudging ring or fence;<br>
Each act was a perfection and a joy.<br>
Abandoned to her rapid fancy’s moods<br>
And the rich coloured riot of her mind,<br>
Initiate of divine and mighty dreams,<br>
Magician builder of unnumbered forms<br>
Exploring the measures of the rhythms of God,<br>
At will she wove her wizard wonder-dance,<br>
A Dionysian goddess of delight,<br>
A Bacchant of creative ecstasy.<br>
This world of bliss he saw and felt its call,<br>
But found no way to enter into its joy;<br>
Across the conscious gulf there was no bridge.<br>
A darker air encircled still his soul<br>
Tied to an image of unquiet life.<br>
In spite of yearning mind and longing sense,<br>
To a sad Thought by grey experience formed<br>
And a vision dimmed by care and sorrow and sleep<br>
All this seemed only a bright desirable dream<br>
Conceived in a longing distance by the heart<br>
Of one who walks in the shadow of earth-pain.<br>
Although he once had felt the Eternal’s clasp,<br>
Too near to suffering worlds his nature lived,<br>
And where he stood were entrances of Night.<br>
Hardly, too close beset by the world’s care,<br>
Can the dense mould in which we have been made<br>
Return sheer joy to joy, pure light to light.<br>
For its tormented will to think and live<br>
First to a mingled pain and pleasure woke<br>
<br>
128<br>

CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
And still it keeps the habit of its birth:<br>
A dire duality is our way to be.<br>
In the crude beginnings of this mortal world<br>
Life was not nor mind’s play nor heart’s desire.<br>
When earth was built in the unconscious Void<br>
And nothing was save a material scene,<br>
Identified with sea and sky and stone<br>
Her young gods yearned for the release of souls<br>
Asleep in objects, vague, inanimate.<br>
In that desolate grandeur, in that beauty bare,<br>
In the deaf stillness, mid the unheeded sounds,<br>
Heavy was the uncommunicated load<br>
Of Godhead in a world that had no needs;<br>
For none was there to feel or to receive.<br>
This solid mass which brooked no throb of sense<br>
Could not contain their vast creative urge:<br>
Immersed no more in Matter’s harmony,<br>
The Spirit lost its statuesque repose.<br>
In the uncaring trance it groped for sight,<br>
Passioned for the movements of a conscious heart,<br>
Famishing for speech and thought and joy and love,<br>
In the dumb insensitive wheeling day and night<br>
Hungered for the beat of yearning and response.<br>
The poised inconscience shaken with a touch,<br>
The intuitive Silence trembling with a name,<br>
They cried to Life to invade the senseless mould<br>
And in brute forms awake divinity.<br>
A voice was heard on the mute rolling globe,<br>
A murmur moaned in the unlistening Void.<br>
A being seemed to breathe where once was none:<br>
Something pent up in dead insentient depths,<br>
Denied conscious existence, lost to joy,<br>
Turned as if one asleep since dateless time.<br>
Aware of its own buried reality,<br>
Remembering its forgotten self and right,<br>
It yearned to know, to aspire, to enjoy, to live.<br>
<br>

<br>
Life heard the call and left her native light.<br>
Overflowing from her bright magnificent plane<br>
On the rigid coil and sprawl of mortal Space,<br>
Here too the gracious great-winged Angel poured<br>
Her splendour and her swiftness and her bliss,<br>
Hoping to fill a fair new world with joy.<br>
As comes a goddess to a mortal’s breast<br>
And fills his days with her celestial clasp,<br>
She stooped to make her home in transient shapes;<br>
In Matter’s womb she cast the Immortal’s fire,<br>
In the unfeeling Vast woke thought and hope,<br>
Smote with her charm and beauty flesh and nerve<br>
And forced delight on earth’s insensible frame.<br>
Alive and clad with trees and herbs and flowers<br>
Earth’s great brown body smiled towards the skies,<br>
Azure replied to azure in the sea’s laugh;<br>
New sentient creatures filled the unseen depths,<br>
Life’s glory and swiftness ran in the beauty of beasts,<br>
Man dared and thought and met with his soul the world.<br>
But while the magic breath was on its way,<br>
Before her gifts could reach our prisoned hearts,<br>
A dark ambiguous Presence questioned all.<br>
The secret Will that robes itself with Night<br>
And offers to spirit the ordeal of the flesh,<br>
Imposed a mystic mask of death and pain.<br>
Interned now in the slow and suffering years<br>
Sojourns the winged and wonderful wayfarer<br>
And can no more recall her happier state,<br>
But must obey the inert Inconscient’s law,<br>
Insensible foundation of a world<br>
In which blind limits are on beauty laid<br>
And sorrow and joy as struggling comrades live.<br>
A dim and dreadful muteness fell on her:<br>
Abolished was her subtle mighty spirit<br>
And slain her boon of child-god happiness,<br>
And all her glory into littleness turned<br>
<br>
130<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Glory and the Fall of Life<br>
<br>
131<br>
<br>
And all her sweetness into a maimed desire.<br>
To feed death with her works is here life’s doom.<br>
So veiled was her immortality that she seemed,<br>
Inflicting consciousness on unconscious things,<br>
An episode in an eternal death,<br>
A myth of being that must for ever cease.<br>
Such was the evil mystery of her change.<br>
END OF CANTO THREE<br>
<br>
Canto Four<br>
<br>
The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
A QUIVERING trepidant uncertain world<br>
Born from that dolorous meeting and eclipse<br>
Appeared in the emptiness where her feet had trod,<br>
A quick obscurity, a seeking stir.<br>
There was a writhing of half-conscious force<br>
Hardly awakened from the Inconscient’s sleep,<br>
Tied to an instinct-driven Ignorance,<br>
To find itself and find its hold on things.<br>
Inheritor of poverty and loss,<br>
Assailed by memories that fled when seized,<br>
Haunted by a forgotten uplifting hope,<br>
It strove with a blindness as of groping hands<br>
To fill the aching and disastrous gap<br>
Between earth-pain and the bliss from which Life fell.<br>
A world that ever seeks for something missed,<br>
Hunts for the joy that earth has failed to keep.<br>
Too near to our gates its unappeased unrest<br>
For peace to live on the inert solid globe:<br>
It has joined its hunger to the hunger of earth,<br>
It has given the law of craving to our lives,<br>
It has made our spirit’s need a fathomless gulf.<br>
An Influence entered mortal night and day,<br>
A shadow overcast the time-born race;<br>
In the troubled stream where leaps a blind heart-pulse<br>
And the nerve-beat of feeling wakes in sense<br>
Dividing Matter’s sleep from conscious Mind,<br>
There strayed a call that knew not why it came.<br>
A Power beyond earth’s scope has touched the earth;<br>
The repose that might have been can be no more;<br>
A formless yearning passions in man’s heart,<br>
A cry is in his blood for happier things:<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
Else could he roam on a free sunlit soil<br>
With the childlike pain-forgetting mind of beasts<br>
Or live happy, unmoved, like flowers and trees.<br>
The Might that came upon the earth to bless,<br>
Has stayed on earth to suffer and aspire.<br>
The infant laugh that rang through time is hushed:<br>
Man’s natural joy of life is overcast<br>
And sorrow is his nurse of destiny.<br>
The animal’s thoughtless joy is left behind,<br>
Care and reflection burden his daily walk;<br>
He has risen to greatness and to discontent,<br>
He is awake to the Invisible.<br>
Insatiate seeker, he has all to learn:<br>
He has exhausted now life’s surface acts,<br>
His being’s hidden realms remain to explore.<br>
He becomes a mind, he becomes a spirit and self;<br>
In his fragile tenement he grows Nature’s lord.<br>
In him Matter wakes from its long obscure trance,<br>
In him earth feels the Godhead drawing near.<br>
An eyeless Power that sees no more its aim,<br>
A restless hungry energy of Will,<br>
Life cast her seed in the body’s indolent mould;<br>
It woke from happy torpor a blind Force<br>
Compelling it to sense and seek and feel.<br>
In the enormous labour of the Void<br>
Perturbing with her dreams the vast routine<br>
And dead roll of a slumbering universe<br>
The mighty prisoner struggled for release.<br>
Alive with her yearning woke the inert cell,<br>
In the heart she kindled a fire of passion and need,<br>
Amid the deep calm of inanimate things<br>
Arose her great voice of toil and prayer and strife.<br>
A groping consciousness in a voiceless world,<br>
A guideless sense was given her for her road;<br>
Thought was withheld and nothing now she knew,<br>
But all the unknown was hers to feel and clasp.<br>
<br>
133<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Obeying the push of unborn things towards birth<br>
Out of her seal of insentient life she broke:<br>
In her substance of unthinking mute soul-strength<br>
That cannot utter what its depths divine,<br>
Awoke a blind necessity to know.<br>
The chain that bound her she made her instrument;<br>
Instinct was hers, the chrysalis of Truth,<br>
And effort and growth and striving nescience.<br>
Inflicting on the body desire and hope,<br>
Imposing on inconscience consciousness,<br>
She brought into Matter’s dull tenacity<br>
Her anguished claim to her lost sovereign right,<br>
Her tireless search, her vexed uneasy heart,<br>
Her wandering unsure steps, her cry for change.<br>
Adorer of a joy without a name,<br>
In her obscure cathedral of delight<br>
To dim dwarf gods she offers secret rites.<br>
But vain unending is the sacrifice,<br>
The priest an ignorant mage who only makes<br>
Futile mutations in the altar’s plan<br>
And casts blind hopes into a powerless flame.<br>
A burden of transient gains weighs down her steps<br>
And hardly under that load can she advance;<br>
But the hours cry to her, she travels on<br>
Passing from thought to thought, from want to want;<br>
Her greatest progress is a deepened need.<br>
Matter dissatisfies, she turns to Mind;<br>
She conquers earth, her field, then claims the heavens.<br>
Insensible, breaking the work she has done<br>
The stumbling ages over her labour pass,<br>
But still no great transforming light came down<br>
And no revealing rapture touched her fall.<br>
Only a glimmer sometimes splits mind’s sky<br>
Justifying the ambiguous providence<br>
That makes of night a path to unknown dawns<br>
Or a dark clue to some diviner state.<br>
<br>
134<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
In Nescience began her mighty task,<br>
In Ignorance she pursues the unfinished work,<br>
For knowledge gropes, but meets not Wisdom’s face.<br>
Ascending slowly with unconscious steps,<br>
A foundling of the Gods she wanders here<br>
Like a child-soul left near the gates of Hell<br>
Fumbling through fog in search of Paradise.<br>
In this slow ascension he must follow her pace<br>
Even from her faint and dim subconscious start:<br>
So only can earth’s last salvation come.<br>
For so only could he know the obscure cause<br>
Of all that holds us back and baffles God<br>
In the jail-delivery of the imprisoned soul.<br>
Along swift paths of fall through dangerous gates<br>
He chanced into a grey obscurity<br>
Teeming with instincts from the mindless gulfs<br>
That pushed to wear a form and win a place.<br>
Life here was intimate with Death and Night<br>
And ate Death’s food that she might breathe awhile;<br>
She was their inmate and adopted waif.<br>
Accepting subconscience, in dumb darkness’ reign<br>
A sojourner, she hoped not any more.<br>
There far away from Truth and luminous thought<br>
He saw the original seat, the separate birth<br>
Of the dethroned, deformed and suffering Power.<br>
An unhappy face of falsity made true,<br>
A contradiction of our divine birth,<br>
Indifferent to beauty and to light,<br>
Parading she flaunted her animal disgrace<br>
Unhelped by camouflage, brutal and bare,<br>
An authentic image recognised and signed<br>
Of her outcast force exiled from heaven and hope,<br>
Fallen, glorying in the vileness of her state,<br>
The grovel of a strength once half divine,<br>
The graceless squalor of her beast desires,<br>
<br>
135<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
The staring visage of her ignorance,<br>
The naked body of her poverty.<br>
Here first she crawled out from her cabin of mud<br>
Where she had lain inconscient, rigid, mute:<br>
Its narrowness and torpor held her still,<br>
A darkness clung to her uneffaced by Light.<br>
There neared no touch redeeming from above:<br>
The upward look was alien to her sight,<br>
Forgotten the fearless godhead of her walk;<br>
Renounced was the glory and felicity,<br>
The adventure in the dangerous fields of Time:<br>
Hardly she availed, wallowing, to bear and live.<br>
A wide unquiet mist of seeking Space,<br>
A rayless region swallowed in vague swathes,<br>
That seemed, unnamed, unbodied and unhoused,<br>
A swaddled visionless and formless mind,<br>
Asked for a body to translate its soul.<br>
Its prayer denied, it fumbled after thought.<br>
As yet not powered to think, hardly to live,<br>
It opened into a weird and pigmy world<br>
Where this unhappy magic had its source.<br>
On dim confines where Life and Matter meet<br>
He wandered among things half-seen, half-guessed,<br>
Pursued by ungrasped beginnings and lost ends.<br>
There life was born but died before it could live.<br>
There was no solid ground, no constant drift;<br>
Only some flame of mindless Will had power.<br>
Himself was dim to himself, half-felt, obscure,<br>
As if in a struggle of the Void to be.<br>
In strange domains where all was living sense<br>
But mastering thought was not nor cause nor rule,<br>
Only a crude child-heart cried for toys of bliss,<br>
Mind flickered, a disordered infant glow,<br>
And random shapeless energies drove towards form<br>
And took each wisp-fire for a guiding sun.<br>
<br>
136<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
This blindfold force could place no thinking step;<br>
Asking for light she followed darkness’ clue.<br>
An inconscient Power groped towards consciousness,<br>
Matter smitten by Matter glimmered to sense,<br>
Blind contacts, slow reactions beat out sparks<br>
Of instinct from a cloaked subliminal bed,<br>
Sensations crowded, dumb substitutes for thought,<br>
Perception answered Nature’s wakening blows<br>
But still was a mechanical response,<br>
A jerk, a leap, a start in Nature’s dream,<br>
And rude unchastened impulses jostling ran<br>
Heedless of every motion but their own<br>
And, darkling, clashed with darker than themselves,<br>
Free in a world of settled anarchy.<br>
The need to exist, the instinct to survive<br>
Engrossed the tense precarious moment’s will<br>
And an unseeing desire felt out for food.<br>
The gusts of Nature were the only law,<br>
Force wrestled with force, but no result remained:<br>
Only were achieved a nescient grasp and drive<br>
And feelings and instincts knowing not their source,<br>
Sense-pleasures and sense-pangs soon caught, soon lost,<br>
And the brute motion of unthinking lives.<br>
It was a vain unnecessary world<br>
Whose will to be brought poor and sad results<br>
And meaningless suffering and a grey unease.<br>
Nothing seemed worth the labour to become.<br>
But judged not so his spirit’s wakened eye.<br>
As shines a solitary witness star<br>
That burns apart, Light’s lonely sentinel,<br>
In the drift and teeming of a mindless Night,<br>
A single thinker in an aimless world<br>
Awaiting some tremendous dawn of God,<br>
He saw the purpose in the works of Time.<br>
Even in that aimlessness a work was done<br>
<br>
137<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Pregnant with magic will and change divine.<br>
The first writhings of the cosmic serpent Force<br>
Uncoiled from the mystic ring of Matter’s trance;<br>
It raised its head in the warm air of life.<br>
It could not cast off yet Night’s stiffening sleep<br>
Or wear as yet mind’s wonder-flecks and streaks,<br>
Put on its jewelled hood the crown of soul<br>
Or stand erect in the blaze of spirit’s sun.<br>
As yet were only seen foulness and force,<br>
The secret crawl of consciousness to light<br>
Through a fertile slime of lust and battening sense,<br>
Beneath the body’s crust of thickened self<br>
A tardy fervent working in the dark,<br>
The turbid yeast of Nature’s passionate change,<br>
Ferment of the soul’s creation out of mire.<br>
A heavenly process donned this grey disguise,<br>
A fallen ignorance in its covert night<br>
Laboured to achieve its dumb unseemly work,<br>
A camouflage of the Inconscient’s need<br>
To release the glory of God in Nature’s mud.<br>
His sight, spiritual in embodying orbs,<br>
Could pierce through the grey phosphorescent haze<br>
And scan the secrets of the shifting flux<br>
That animates these mute and solid cells<br>
And leads the thought and longing of the flesh<br>
And the keen lust and hunger of its will.<br>
This too he tracked along its hidden stream<br>
And traced its acts to a miraculous fount.<br>
A mystic Presence none can probe nor rule,<br>
Creator of this game of ray and shade<br>
In this sweet and bitter paradoxical life,<br>
Asks from the body the soul’s intimacies<br>
And by the swift vibration of a nerve<br>
Links its mechanic throbs to light and love.<br>
It summons the spirit’s sleeping memories<br>
Up from subconscient depths beneath Time’s foam;<br>
<br>
138<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
Oblivious of their flame of happy truth,<br>
Arriving with heavy eyes that hardly see,<br>
They come disguised as feelings and desires,<br>
Like weeds upon the surface float awhile<br>
And rise and sink on a somnambulist tide.<br>
Impure, degraded though her motions are,<br>
Always a heaven-truth broods in life’s deeps;<br>
In her obscurest members burns that fire.<br>
A touch of God’s rapture in creation’s acts,<br>
A lost remembrance of felicity<br>
Lurks still in the dumb roots of death and birth,<br>
The world’s senseless beauty mirrors God’s delight.<br>
That rapture’s smile is secret everywhere;<br>
It flows in the wind’s breath, in the tree’s sap,<br>
Its hued magnificence blooms in leaves and flowers.<br>
When life broke through its half-drowse in the plant<br>
That feels and suffers but cannot move or cry,<br>
In beast and in winged bird and thinking man<br>
It made of the heart’s rhythm its music’s beat;<br>
It forced the unconscious tissues to awake<br>
And ask for happiness and earn the pang<br>
And thrill with pleasure and laughter of brief delight,<br>
And quiver with pain and crave for ecstasy.<br>
Imperative, voiceless, ill-understood,<br>
Too far from light, too close to being’s core,<br>
Born strangely in Time from the eternal Bliss,<br>
It presses on heart’s core and vibrant nerve;<br>
Its sharp self-seeking tears our consciousness;<br>
Our pain and pleasure have that sting for cause:<br>
Instinct with it, but blind to its true joy<br>
The soul’s desire leaps out towards passing things.<br>
All Nature’s longing drive none can resist,<br>
Comes surging through the blood and quickened sense;<br>
An ecstasy of the infinite is her cause.<br>
It turns in us to finite loves and lusts,<br>
The will to conquer and have, to seize and keep,<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
To enlarge life’s room and scope and pleasure’s range,<br>
To battle and overcome and make one’s own,<br>
The hope to mix one’s joy with others’ joy,<br>
A yearning to possess and be possessed,<br>
To enjoy and be enjoyed, to feel, to live.<br>
Here was its early brief attempt to be,<br>
Its rapid end of momentary delight<br>
Whose stamp of failure haunts all ignorant life.<br>
Inflicting still its habit on the cells<br>
The phantom of a dark and evil start<br>
Ghostlike pursues all that we dream and do.<br>
Although on earth are firm established lives,<br>
A working of habit or a sense of law,<br>
A steady repetition in the flux,<br>
Yet are its roots of will ever the same;<br>
These passions are the stuff of which we are made.<br>
This was the first cry of the awaking world.<br>
It clings around us still and clamps the god.<br>
Even when reason is born and soul takes form,<br>
In beast and reptile and in thinking man<br>
It lasts and is the fount of all their life.<br>
This too was needed that breath and living might be.<br>
The spirit in a finite ignorant world<br>
Must rescue so its prisoned consciousness<br>
Forced out in little jets at quivering points<br>
From the Inconscient’s sealed infinitude.<br>
Then slowly it gathers mass, looks up at Light.<br>
This Nature lives tied to her origin,<br>
A clutch of nether force is on her still;<br>
Out of unconscious depths her instincts leap;<br>
A neighbour is her life to insentient Nought.<br>
Under this law an ignorant world was made.<br>
In the enigma of the darkened Vasts,<br>
In the passion and self-loss of the Infinite<br>
When all was plunged in the negating Void,<br>
Non-Being’s night could never have been saved<br>

If Being had not plunged into the dark<br>
Carrying with it its triple mystic cross.<br>
Invoking in world-time the timeless truth,<br>
Bliss changed to sorrow, knowledge made ignorant,<br>
God’s force turned into a child’s helplessness<br>
Can bring down heaven by their sacrifice.<br>
A contradiction founds the base of life:<br>
The eternal, the divine Reality<br>
Has faced itself with its own contraries;<br>
Being became the Void and Conscious-Force<br>
Nescience and walk of a blind Energy<br>
And Ecstasy took the figure of world-pain.<br>
In a mysterious dispensation’s law<br>
A Wisdom that prepares its far-off ends<br>
Planned so to start her slow aeonic game.<br>
A blindfold search and wrestle and fumbling clasp<br>
Of a half-seen Nature and a hidden Soul,<br>
A game of hide-and-seek in twilit rooms,<br>
A play of love and hate and fear and hope<br>
Continues in the nursery of mind<br>
Its hard and heavy romp of self-born twins.<br>
At last the struggling Energy can emerge<br>
And meet the voiceless Being in wider fields;<br>
Then can they see and speak and, breast to breast,<br>
In a larger consciousness, a clearer light,<br>
The Two embrace and strive and each know each<br>
Regarding closer now the playmate’s face.<br>
Even in these formless coilings he could feel<br>
Matter’s response to an infant stir of soul.<br>
In Nature he saw the mighty Spirit concealed,<br>
Watched the weak birth of a tremendous Force,<br>
Pursued the riddle of Godhead’s tentative pace,<br>
Heard the faint rhythms of a great unborn Muse.<br>
Then came a fierier breath of waking Life,<br>
And there arose from the dim gulf of things<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
The strange creations of a thinking sense,<br>
Existences half-real and half-dream.<br>
A life was there that hoped not to survive:<br>
Beings were born who perished without trace,<br>
Events that were a formless drama’s limbs<br>
And actions driven by a blind creature will.<br>
A seeking Power found out its road to form,<br>
Patterns were built of love and joy and pain<br>
And symbol figures for the moods of Life.<br>
An insect hedonism fluttered and crawled<br>
And basked in a sunlit Nature’s surface thrills,<br>
And dragon raptures, python agonies<br>
Crawled in the marsh and mire and licked the sun.<br>
Huge armoured strengths shook a frail quaking ground,<br>
Great puissant creatures with a dwarfish brain,<br>
And pigmy tribes imposed their small life-drift.<br>
In a dwarf model of humanity<br>
Nature now launched the extreme experience<br>
And master-point of her design’s caprice,<br>
Luminous result of her half-conscious climb<br>
On rungs twixt her sublimities and grotesques<br>
To massive from infinitesimal shapes,<br>
To a subtle balancing of body and soul,<br>
To an order of intelligent littleness.<br>
Around him in the moment-beats of Time<br>
The kingdom of the animal self arose,<br>
Where deed is all and mind is still half-born<br>
And the heart obeys a dumb unseen control.<br>
The Force that works by the light of Ignorance,<br>
Her animal experiment began,<br>
Crowding with conscious creatures her world-scheme;<br>
But to the outward only were they alive,<br>
Only they replied to touches and surfaces<br>
And to the prick of need that drove their lives.<br>
A body that knew not its own soul within,<br>
There lived and longed, had wrath and joy and grief;<br>
<br>
142<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
A mind was there that met the objective world<br>
As if a stranger or enemy at its door:<br>
Its thoughts were kneaded by the shocks of sense;<br>
It captured not the spirit in the form,<br>
It entered not the heart of what it saw;<br>
It looked not for the power behind the act,<br>
It studied not the hidden motive in things<br>
Nor strove to find the meaning of it all.<br>
Beings were there who wore a human form;<br>
Absorbed they lived in the passion of the scene,<br>
But knew not who they were or why they lived:<br>
Content to breathe, to feel, to sense, to act,<br>
Life had for them no aim save Nature’s joy<br>
And the stimulus and delight of outer things;<br>
Identified with the spirit’s outward shell,<br>
They worked for the body’s wants, they craved no more.<br>
The veiled spectator watching from their depths<br>
Fixed not his inward eye upon himself<br>
Nor turned to find the author of the plot,<br>
He saw the drama only and the stage.<br>
There was no brooding stress of deeper sense,<br>
The burden of reflection was not borne:<br>
Mind looked on Nature with unknowing eyes,<br>
Adored her boons and feared her monstrous strokes.<br>
It pondered not on the magic of her laws,<br>
It thirsted not for the secret wells of Truth,<br>
But made a register of crowding facts<br>
And strung sensations on a vivid thread:<br>
It hunted and it fled and sniffed the winds,<br>
Or slothed inert in sunshine and soft air:<br>
It sought the engrossing contacts of the world,<br>
But only to feed the surface sense with bliss.<br>
These felt life’s quiver in the outward touch,<br>
They could not feel behind the touch the soul.<br>
To guard their form of self from Nature’s harm,<br>
To enjoy and to survive was all their care.<br>

<br>
The narrow horizon of their days was filled<br>
With things and creatures that could help and hurt:<br>
The world’s values hung upon their little self.<br>
Isolated, cramped in the vast unknown,<br>
To save their small lives from surrounding Death<br>
They made a tiny circle of defence<br>
Against the siege of the huge universe:<br>
They preyed upon the world and were its prey,<br>
But never dreamed to conquer and be free.<br>
Obeying the World-Power’s hints and firm taboos<br>
A scanty part they drew from her rich store;<br>
There was no conscious code and no life-plan:<br>
The patterns of thinking of a little group<br>
Fixed a traditional behaviour’s law.<br>
Ignorant of soul save as a wraith within,<br>
Tied to a mechanism of unchanging lives<br>
And to a dull usual sense and feeling’s beat,<br>
They turned in grooves of animal desire.<br>
In walls of stone fenced round they worked and warred,<br>
Did by a banded selfishness a small good<br>
Or wrought a dreadful wrong and cruel pain<br>
On sentient lives and thought they did no ill.<br>
Ardent from the sack of happy peaceful homes<br>
And gorged with slaughter, plunder, rape and fire,<br>
They made of human selves their helpless prey,<br>
A drove of captives led to lifelong woe,<br>
Or torture a spectacle made and holiday,<br>
Mocking or thrilled by their torn victims’ pangs;<br>
Admiring themselves as titans and as gods<br>
Proudly they sang their high and glorious deeds<br>
And praised their victory and their splendid force.<br>
An animal in the instinctive herd<br>
Pushed by life impulses, forced by common needs,<br>
Each in his own kind saw his ego’s glass;<br>
All served the aim and action of the pack.<br>
Those like himself, by blood or custom kin,<br>
<br>
144<br>

<br>
To him were parts of his life, his adjunct selves,<br>
His personal nebula’s constituent stars,<br>
Satellite companions of his solar I.<br>
A master of his life’s environment,<br>
A leader of a huddled human mass<br>
Herding for safety on a dangerous earth,<br>
He gathered them round him as if minor Powers<br>
To make a common front against the world,<br>
Or, weak and sole on an indifferent earth,<br>
As a fortress for his undefended heart,<br>
Or else to heal his body’s loneliness.<br>
In others than his kind he sensed a foe,<br>
An alien unlike force to shun and fear,<br>
A stranger and adversary to hate and slay.<br>
Or he lived as lives the solitary brute;<br>
At war with all he bore his single fate.<br>
Absorbed in the present act, the fleeting days,<br>
None thought to look beyond the hour’s gains,<br>
Or dreamed to make this earth a fairer world,<br>
Or felt some touch divine surprise his heart.<br>
The gladness that the fugitive moment gave,<br>
The desire grasped, the bliss, the experience won,<br>
Movement and speed and strength were joy enough<br>
And bodily longings shared and quarrel and play,<br>
And tears and laughter and the need called love.<br>
In war and clasp these life-wants joined the All-Life,<br>
Wrestlings of a divided unity<br>
Inflicting mutual grief and happiness<br>
In ignorance of the Self for ever one.<br>
Arming its creatures with delight and hope<br>
A half-awakened Nescience struggled there<br>
To know by sight and touch the outside of things.<br>
Instinct was formed; in memory’s crowded sleep<br>
The past lived on as in a bottomless sea:<br>
Inverting into half-thought the quickened sense<br>
She felt around for truth with fumbling hands,<br>
<br>
145<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Clutched to her the little she could reach and seize<br>
And put aside in her subconscient cave.<br>
So must the dim being grow in light and force<br>
And rise to his higher destiny at last,<br>
Look up to God and round at the universe,<br>
And learn by failure and progress by fall<br>
And battle with environment and doom,<br>
By suffering discover his deep soul<br>
And by possession grow to his own vasts.<br>
Half-way she stopped and found her path no more.<br>
Still nothing was achieved but to begin,<br>
Yet finished seemed the circle of her force.<br>
Only she had beaten out sparks of ignorance;<br>
Only the life could think and not the mind,<br>
Only the sense could feel and not the soul.<br>
Only was lit some heat of the flame of Life,<br>
Some joy to be, some rapturous leaps of sense.<br>
All was an impetus of half-conscious Force,<br>
A spirit sprawling drowned in dense life-foam,<br>
A vague self grasping at the shape of things.<br>
Behind all moved seeking for vessels to hold<br>
A first raw vintage of the grapes of God,<br>
On earth’s mud a spilth of the supernal Bliss,<br>
Intoxicating the stupefied soul and mind<br>
A heady wine of rapture dark and crude,<br>
Dim, uncast yet into spiritual form,<br>
Obscure inhabitant of the world’s blind core,<br>
An unborn godhead’s will, a mute Desire.<br>
A third creation now revealed its face.<br>
A mould of body’s early mind was made.<br>
A glint of light kindled the obscure World-Force;<br>
It dowered a driven world with the seeing Idea<br>
And armed the act with thought’s dynamic point:<br>
A small thinking being watched the works of Time.<br>
A difficult evolution from below<br>
<br>
146<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
Called a masked intervention from above;<br>
Else this great, blind inconscient universe<br>
Could never have disclosed its hidden mind,<br>
Or even in blinkers worked in beast and man<br>
The Intelligence that devised the cosmic scheme.<br>
At first he saw a dim obscure mind-power<br>
Moving concealed by Matter and dumb life.<br>
A current thin, it streamed in life’s vast flow<br>
Tossing and drifting under a drifting sky<br>
Amid the surge and glimmering tremulous wash,<br>
Released in splash of sense and feeling’s waves.<br>
In the deep midst of an insentient world<br>
Its huddled waves and foam of consciousness ran<br>
Pressing and eddying through a narrow strait,<br>
Carrying experience in its crowded pace.<br>
It flowed emerging into upper light<br>
From the deep pool of its subliminal birth<br>
To reach some high existence still unknown.<br>
There was no thinking self, aim there was none:<br>
All was unorganised stress and seekings vague.<br>
Only to the unstable surface rose<br>
Sensations, stabs and edges of desire<br>
And passion’s leaps and brief emotion’s cries,<br>
A casual colloquy of flesh with flesh,<br>
A murmur of heart to longing wordless heart,<br>
Glimmerings of knowledge with no shape of thought<br>
And jets of subconscious will or hunger’s pulls.<br>
All was dim sparkle on a foaming top:<br>
It whirled around a drifting shadow-self<br>
On an inconscient flood of Force in Time.<br>
Then came the pressure of a seeing Power<br>
That drew all into a dancing turbid mass<br>
Circling around a single luminous point,<br>
Centre of reference in a conscious field,<br>
Figure of a unitary Light within.<br>
It lit the impulse of the half-sentient flood,<br>
<br>
147<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Even an illusion gave of fixity<br>
As if a sea could serve as a firm soil.<br>
That strange observing Power imposed its sight.<br>
It forced on flux a limit and a shape,<br>
It gave its stream a lower narrow bank,<br>
Drew lines to snare the spirit’s formlessness.<br>
It fashioned the life-mind of bird and beast,<br>
The answer of the reptile and the fish,<br>
The primitive pattern of the thoughts of man.<br>
A finite movement of the Infinite<br>
Came winging its way through a wide air of Time;<br>
A march of knowledge moved in Nescience<br>
And guarded in the form a separate soul.<br>
Its right to be immortal it reserved,<br>
But built a wall against the siege of death<br>
And threw a hook to clutch eternity.<br>
A thinking entity appeared in Space.<br>
A little ordered world broke into view<br>
Where being had prison-room for act and sight,<br>
A floor to walk, a clear but scanty range.<br>
An instrument-personality was born,<br>
And a restricted clamped intelligence<br>
Consented to confine in narrow bounds<br>
Its seeking; it tied the thought to visible things,<br>
Prohibiting the adventure of the Unseen<br>
And the soul’s tread through unknown infinities.<br>
A reflex reason, Nature-habit’s glass<br>
Illumined life to know and fix its field,<br>
Accept a dangerous ignorant brevity<br>
And the inconclusive purpose of its walk<br>
And profit by the hour’s precarious chance<br>
In the allotted boundaries of its fate.<br>
A little joy and knowledge satisfied<br>
This little being tied into a knot<br>
And hung on a bulge of its environment,<br>
A little curve cut off in measureless Space,<br>
<br>
148<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Kingdoms of the Little Life<br>
<br>
A little span of life in all vast Time.<br>
A thought was there that planned, a will that strove,<br>
But for small aims within a narrow scope,<br>
Wasting unmeasured toil on transient things.<br>
It knew itself a creature of the mud;<br>
It asked no larger law, no loftier aim;<br>
It had no inward look, no upward gaze.<br>
A backward scholar on logic’s rickety bench<br>
Indoctrinated by the erring sense,<br>
It took appearance for the face of God,<br>
For casual lights the marching of the suns,<br>
For heaven a starry strip of doubtful blue;<br>
Aspects of being feigned to be the whole.<br>
There was a voice of busy interchange,<br>
A market-place of trivial thoughts and acts:<br>
A life soon spent, a mind the body’s slave<br>
Here seemed the brilliant crown of Nature’s work,<br>
And tiny egos took the world as means<br>
To sate awhile dwarf lusts and brief desires,<br>
In a death-closed passage saw life’s start and end<br>
As though a blind alley were creation’s sign,<br>
As if for this the soul had coveted birth<br>
In the wonderland of a self-creating world<br>
And the opportunities of cosmic Space.<br>
This creature passionate only to survive,<br>
Fettered to puny thoughts with no wide range<br>
And to the body’s needs and pangs and joys,<br>
This fire growing by its fuel’s death,<br>
Increased by what it seized and made its own:<br>
It gathered and grew and gave itself to none.<br>
Only it hoped for greatness in its den<br>
And pleasure and victory in small fields of power<br>
And conquest of life-room for self and kin,<br>
An animal limited by its feeding-space.<br>
It knew not the Immortal in its house;<br>
It had no greater deeper cause to live.<br>
<br>

<br>
In limits only it was powerful;<br>
Acute to capture truth for outward use,<br>
Its knowledge was the body’s instrument;<br>
Absorbed in the little works of its prison-house<br>
It turned around the same unchanging points<br>
In the same circle of interest and desire,<br>
But thought itself the master of its jail.<br>
Although for action, not for wisdom made,<br>
Thought was its apex — or its gutter’s rim:<br>
It saw an image of the external world<br>
And saw its surface self, but knew no more.<br>
Out of a slow confused embroiled self-search<br>
Mind grew to a clarity cut out, precise,<br>
A gleam enclosed in a stone ignorance.<br>
In this bound thinking’s narrow leadership<br>
Tied to the soil, inspired by common things,<br>
Attached to a confined familiar world,<br>
Amid the multitude of her motived plots,<br>
Her changing actors and her million masks,<br>
Life was a play monotonously the same.<br>
There were no vast perspectives of the spirit,<br>
No swift invasions of unknown delight,<br>
No golden distances of wide release.<br>
This petty state resembled our human days<br>
But fixed to eternity of changeless type,<br>
A moment’s movement doomed to last through Time.<br>
Existence bridge-like spanned the inconscient gulfs,<br>
A half-illumined building in a mist,<br>
Which from a void of Form arose to sight<br>
And jutted out into a void of Soul.<br>
A little light in a great darkness born,<br>
Life knew not where it went nor whence it came.<br>
Around all floated still the nescient haze.<br>

The Godheads of the Little Life<br>
A FIXED and narrow power with rigid forms,<br>
He saw the empire of the little life,<br>
An unhappy corner in eternity.<br>
It lived upon the margin of the Idea<br>
Protected by Ignorance as in a shell.<br>
Then, hoping to learn the secret of this world<br>
He peered across its scanty fringe of sight,<br>
To disengage from its surface-clear obscurity<br>
The Force that moved it and the Idea that made,<br>
Imposing smallness on the Infinite,<br>
The ruling spirit of its littleness,<br>
The divine law that gave it right to be,<br>
Its claim on Nature and its need in Time.<br>
He plunged his gaze into the siege of mist<br>
That held this ill-lit straitened continent<br>
Ringed with the skies and seas of ignorance<br>
And kept it safe from Truth and Self and Light.<br>
As when a searchlight stabs the Night’s blind breast<br>
And dwellings and trees and figures of men appear<br>
As if revealed to an eye in Nothingness,<br>
All lurking things were torn out of their veils<br>
And held up in his vision’s sun-white blaze.<br>
A busy restless uncouth populace<br>
Teemed in their dusky unnoted thousands there.<br>
In a mist of secrecy wrapping the world-scene<br>
The little deities of Time’s nether act<br>
Who work remote from Heaven’s controlling eye,<br>
Plotted, unknown to the creatures whom they move,<br>
The small conspiracies of this petty reign<br>
Amused with the small contrivings, the brief hopes<br>
And little eager steps and little ways<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
And reptile wallowings in the dark and dust,<br>
And the crouch and ignominy of creeping life.<br>
A trepidant and motley multitude,<br>
A strange pell-mell of magic artisans,<br>
Was seen moulding the plastic clay of life,<br>
An elfin brood, an elemental kind.<br>
Astonished by the unaccustomed glow,<br>
As if immanent in the shadows started up<br>
Imps with wry limbs and carved beast visages,<br>
Sprite-prompters goblin-wizened or faery-small,<br>
And genii fairer but unsouled and poor<br>
And fallen beings, their heavenly portion lost,<br>
And errant divinities trapped in Time’s dust.<br>
Ignorant and dangerous wills but armed with power,<br>
Half-animal, half-god their mood, their shape.<br>
Out of the greyness of a dim background<br>
Their whispers come, an inarticulate force,<br>
Awake in mind an echoing thought or word,<br>
To their sting of impulse the heart’s sanction draw,<br>
And in that little Nature do their work<br>
And fill its powers and creatures with unease.<br>
Its seed of joy they curse with sorrow’s fruit,<br>
Put out with error’s breath its scanty lights<br>
And turn its surface truths to falsehood’s ends,<br>
Its small emotions spur, its passions drive<br>
To the abyss or through the bog and mire:<br>
Or else with a goad of hard dry lusts they prick,<br>
While jogs on devious ways that nowhere lead<br>
Life’s cart finding no issue from ignorance.<br>
To sport with good and evil is their law;<br>
Luring to failure and meaningless success,<br>
All models they corrupt, all measures cheat,<br>
Make knowledge a poison, virtue a pattern dull<br>
And lead the endless cycles of desire<br>
Through semblances of sad or happy chance<br>
To an inescapable fatality.<br>

CANTO V: The Godheads of the Little Life<br>
<br>
All by their influence is enacted there.<br>
Nor there alone is their empire or their role:<br>
Wherever are soulless minds and guideless lives<br>
And in a small body self is all that counts,<br>
Wherever love and light and largeness lack,<br>
These crooked fashioners take up their task.<br>
To all half-conscious worlds they extend their reign.<br>
Here too these godlings drive our human hearts,<br>
Our nature’s twilight is their lurking-place:<br>
Here too the darkened primitive heart obeys<br>
The veiled suggestions of a hidden Mind<br>
That dogs our knowledge with misleading light<br>
And stands between us and the Truth that saves.<br>
It speaks to us with the voices of the Night:<br>
Our darkened lives to greater darkness move;<br>
Our seekings listen to calamitous hopes.<br>
A structure of unseeing thoughts is built<br>
And reason used by an irrational Force.<br>
This earth is not alone our teacher and nurse;<br>
The powers of all the worlds have entrance here.<br>
In their own fields they follow the wheel of law<br>
And cherish the safety of a settled type;<br>
On earth out of their changeless orbit thrown<br>
Their law is kept, lost their fixed form of things.<br>
Into a creative chaos they are cast<br>
Where all asks order but is driven by Chance;<br>
Strangers to earth-nature, they must learn earth’s ways,<br>
Aliens or opposites, they must unite:<br>
They work and battle and with pain agree:<br>
These join, those part, all parts and joins anew,<br>
But never can we know and truly live<br>
Till all have found their divine harmony.<br>
Our life’s uncertain way winds circling on,<br>
Our mind’s unquiet search asks always light,<br>
Till they have learned their secret in their source,<br>
In the light of the Timeless and its spaceless home,<br>

In the joy of the Eternal sole and one.<br>
But now the Light supreme is far away:<br>
Our conscious life obeys the Inconscient’s laws;<br>
To ignorant purposes and blind desires<br>
Our hearts are moved by an ambiguous force;<br>
Even our mind’s conquests wear a battered crown.<br>
A slowly changing order binds our will.<br>
This is our doom until our souls are free.<br>
A mighty Hand then rolls mind’s firmaments back,<br>
Infinity takes up the finite’s acts<br>
And Nature steps into the eternal Light.<br>
Then only ends this dream of nether life.<br>
At the outset of this enigmatic world<br>
Which seems at once an enormous brute machine<br>
And a slow unmasking of the spirit in things,<br>
In this revolving chamber without walls<br>
In which God sits impassive everywhere<br>
As if unknown to himself and by us unseen<br>
In a miracle of inconscient secrecy,<br>
Yet is all here his action and his will.<br>
In this whirl and sprawl through infinite vacancy<br>
The Spirit became Matter and lay in the whirl,<br>
A body sleeping without sense or soul.<br>
A mass phenomenon of visible shapes<br>
Supported by the silence of the Void<br>
Appeared in the eternal Consciousness<br>
And seemed an outward and insensible world.<br>
There was none there to see and none to feel;<br>
Only the miraculous Inconscient,<br>
A subtle wizard skilled, was at its task.<br>
Inventing ways for magical results,<br>
Managing creation’s marvellous device,<br>
Marking mechanically dumb wisdom’s points,<br>
Using the unthought inevitable Idea,<br>
It did the works of God’s intelligence<br>
<br>
154<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Godheads of the Little Life<br>
<br>
Or wrought the will of some supreme Unknown.<br>
Still consciousness was hidden in Nature’s womb,<br>
Unfelt was the Bliss whose rapture dreamed the worlds.<br>
Being was an inert substance driven by Force.<br>
At first was only an etheric Space:<br>
Its huge vibrations circled round and round<br>
Housing some unconceived initiative:<br>
Upheld by a supreme original Breath<br>
Expansion and contraction’s mystic act<br>
Created touch and friction in the void,<br>
Into abstract emptiness brought clash and clasp:<br>
Parent of an expanding universe<br>
In a matrix of disintegrating force,<br>
By spending it conserved an endless sum.<br>
On the hearth of Space it kindled a viewless Fire<br>
That, scattering worlds as one might scatter seeds,<br>
Whirled out the luminous order of the stars.<br>
An ocean of electric Energy<br>
Formlessly formed its strange wave-particles<br>
Constructing by their dance this solid scheme,<br>
Its mightiness in the atom shut to rest;<br>
Masses were forged or feigned and visible shapes;<br>
Light flung the photon’s swift revealing spark<br>
And showed, in the minuteness of its flash<br>
Imaged, this cosmos of apparent things.<br>
Thus has been made this real impossible world,<br>
An obvious miracle or convincing show.<br>
Or so it seems to man’s audacious mind<br>
Who seats his thought as the arbiter of truth,<br>
His personal vision as impersonal fact,<br>
As witnesses of an objective world<br>
His erring sense and his instruments’ artifice.<br>
Thus must he work life’s tangible riddle out<br>
In a doubtful light, by error seize on Truth<br>
And slowly part the visage and the veil.<br>
Or else, forlorn of faith in mind and sense,<br>

His knowledge a bright body of ignorance,<br>
He sees in all things strangely fashioned here<br>
The unwelcome jest of a deceiving Force,<br>
A parable of Maya and her might.<br>
This vast perpetual motion caught and held<br>
In the mysterious and unchanging change<br>
Of the persistent movement we call Time<br>
And ever renewing its recurrent beat,<br>
These mobile rounds that stereotype a flux,<br>
These static objects in the cosmic dance<br>
That are but Energy’s self-repeating whorls<br>
Prolonged by the spirit of the brooding Void,<br>
Awaited life and sense and waking Mind.<br>
A little the Dreamer changed his pose of stone.<br>
But when the Inconscient’s scrupulous work was done<br>
And Chance coerced by fixed immutable laws,<br>
A scene was set for Nature’s conscious play.<br>
Then stirred the Spirit’s mute immobile sleep;<br>
The Force concealed broke dumbly, slowly out.<br>
A dream of living woke in Matter’s heart,<br>
A will to live moved the Inconscient’s dust,<br>
A freak of living startled vacant Time,<br>
Ephemeral in a blank eternity,<br>
Infinitesimal in a dead Infinite.<br>
A subtler breath quickened dead Matter’s forms;<br>
The world’s set rhythm changed to a conscious cry;<br>
A serpent Power twinned the insensible Force.<br>
Islands of living dotted lifeless Space<br>
And germs of living formed in formless air.<br>
A Life was born that followed Matter’s law,<br>
Ignorant of the motives of its steps;<br>
Ever inconstant, yet for ever the same,<br>
It repeated the paradox that gave it birth:<br>
Its restless and unstable stabilities<br>
Recurred incessantly in the flow of Time<br>
And purposeful movements in unthinking forms<br>

Betrayed the heavings of an imprisoned Will.<br>
Waking and sleep lay locked in mutual arms;<br>
Helpless and indistinct came pleasure and pain<br>
Trembling with the first faint thrills of a World-Soul.<br>
A strength of life that could not cry or move,<br>
Yet broke into beauty signing some deep delight:<br>
An inarticulate sensibility,<br>
Throbs of the heart of an unknowing world,<br>
Ran through its somnolent torpor and there stirred<br>
A vague uncertain thrill, a wandering beat,<br>
A dim unclosing as of secret eyes.<br>
Infant self-feeling grew and birth was born.<br>
A godhead woke but lay with dreaming limbs;<br>
Her house refused to open its sealed doors.<br>
Insentient to our eyes that only see<br>
The form, the act and not the imprisoned God,<br>
Life hid in her pulse occult of growth and power<br>
A consciousness with mute stifled beats of sense,<br>
A mind suppressed that knew not yet of thought,<br>
An inert spirit that could only be.<br>
At first she raised no voice, no motion dared:<br>
Charged with world-power, instinct with living force,<br>
Only she clung with her roots to the safe earth,<br>
Thrilled dumbly to the shocks of ray and breeze<br>
And put out tendril fingers of desire;<br>
The strength in her yearning for sun and light<br>
Felt not the embrace that made her breathe and live;<br>
Absorbed she dreamed content with beauty and hue.<br>
At last the charmed Immensity looked forth:<br>
Astir, vibrant, hungering, she groped for mind;<br>
Then slowly sense quivered and thought peered out;<br>
She forced the reluctant mould to grow aware.<br>
The magic was chiselled of a conscious form;<br>
Its tranced vibrations rhythmed a quick response,<br>
And luminous stirrings prompted brain and nerve,<br>
Awoke in Matter spirit’s identity<br>

And in a body lit the miracle<br>
Of the heart’s love and the soul’s witness gaze.<br>
Impelled by an unseen Will there could break out<br>
Fragments of some vast impulse to become<br>
And vivid glimpses of a secret self,<br>
And the doubtful seeds and force of shapes to be<br>
Awoke from the inconscient swoon of things.<br>
An animal creation crept and ran<br>
And flew and called between the earth and sky,<br>
Hunted by death but hoping still to live<br>
And glad to breathe if only for a while.<br>
Then man was moulded from the original brute.<br>
A thinking mind had come to lift life’s moods,<br>
The keen-edged tool of a Nature mixed and vague,<br>
An intelligence half-witness, half-machine.<br>
This seeming driver of her wheel of works<br>
Missioned to motive and record her drift<br>
And fix its law on her inconstant powers,<br>
This master-spring of a delicate enginery,<br>
Aspired to enlighten its user and refine<br>
Lifting to a vision of the indwelling Power<br>
The absorbed mechanic’s crude initiative:<br>
He raised his eyes; Heaven-light mirrored a Face.<br>
Amazed at the works wrought in her mystic sleep,<br>
She looked upon the world that she had made:<br>
Wondering now seized the great automaton;<br>
She paused to understand her self and aim,<br>
Pondering she learned to act by conscious rule,<br>
A visioned measure guided her rhythmic steps;<br>
Thought bordered her instincts with a frame of will<br>
And lit with the idea her blinded urge.<br>
On her mass of impulses, her reflex acts,<br>
On the Inconscient’s pushed or guided drift<br>
And mystery of unthinking accurate steps<br>
She stuck the specious image of a self,<br>
A living idol of disfigured spirit;<br>

She turned her dream towards some high Unknown;<br>
A breath was felt below of One supreme.<br>
An opening looked up to spheres above<br>
And coloured shadows limned on mortal ground<br>
The passing figures of immortal things;<br>
A quick celestial flash could sometimes come:<br>
The illumined soul-ray fell on heart and flesh<br>
And touched with semblances of ideal light<br>
The stuff of which our earthly dreams are made.<br>
A fragile human love that could not last,<br>
Ego’s moth-wings to lift the seraph soul,<br>
Appeared, a surface glamour of brief date<br>
Extinguished by a scanty breath of Time;<br>
Joy that forgot mortality for a while<br>
Came, a rare visitor who left betimes,<br>
And made all things seem beautiful for an hour,<br>
Hopes that soon fade to drab realities<br>
And passions that crumble to ashes while they blaze<br>
Kindled the common earth with their brief flame.<br>
A creature insignificant and small<br>
Visited, uplifted by an unknown Power,<br>
Man laboured on his little patch of earth<br>
For means to last, to enjoy, to suffer and die.<br>
A spirit that perished not with the body and breath<br>
Was there like a shadow of the Unmanifest<br>
And stood behind the little personal form<br>
But claimed not yet this earthly embodiment.<br>
Assenting to Nature’s long slow-moving toil,<br>
Watching the works of his own Ignorance,<br>
Unknown, unfelt the mighty Witness lives<br>
And nothing shows the Glory that is here.<br>
A Wisdom governing the mystic world,<br>

<br>
A Silence listening to the cry of Life,<br>
It sees the hurrying crowd of moments stream<br>
Towards the still greatness of a distant hour.<br>
This huge world unintelligibly turns<br>
In the shadow of a mused Inconscience;<br>
It hides a key to inner meanings missed,<br>
It locks in our hearts a voice we cannot hear.<br>
An enigmatic labour of the spirit,<br>
An exact machine of which none knows the use,<br>
An art and ingenuity without sense,<br>
This minute elaborate orchestrated life<br>
For ever plays its motiveless symphonies.<br>
The mind learns and knows not, turning its back to truth;<br>
It studies surface laws by surface thought,<br>
Life’s steps surveys and Nature’s process sees,<br>
Not seeing for what she acts or why we live;<br>
It marks her tireless care of just device,<br>
Her patient intricacy of fine detail,<br>
The ingenious spirit’s brave inventive plan<br>
In her great futile mass of endless works,<br>
Adds purposeful figures to her purposeless sum,<br>
Its gabled storeys piles, its climbing roofs<br>
On the close-carved foundations she has laid,<br>
Imagined citadels reared in mythic air<br>
Or mounts a stair of dream to a mystic moon:<br>
Transient creations point and hit the sky:<br>
A world-conjecture’s scheme is laboured out<br>
On the dim floor of mind’s incertitude,<br>
Or painfully built a fragmentary whole.<br>
Impenetrable, a mystery recondite<br>
Is the vast plan of which we are a part;<br>
Its harmonies are discords to our view<br>
Because we know not the great theme they serve.<br>
Inscrutable work the cosmic agencies.<br>
Only the fringe of a wide surge we see;<br>

<br>
Our instruments have not that greater light,<br>
Our will tunes not with the eternal Will,<br>
Our heart’s sight is too blind and passionate.<br>
Impotent to share in Nature’s mystic tact,<br>
Inapt to feel the pulse and core of things,<br>
Our reason cannot sound life’s mighty sea<br>
And only counts its waves and scans its foam;<br>
It knows not whence these motions touch and pass,<br>
It sees not whither sweeps the hurrying flood:<br>
Only it strives to canalise its powers<br>
And hopes to turn its course to human ends:<br>
But all its means come from the Inconscient’s store.<br>
Unseen here act dim huge world-energies<br>
And only trickles and currents are our share.<br>
Our mind lives far off from the authentic Light<br>
Catching at little fragments of the Truth<br>
In a small corner of infinity,<br>
Our lives are inlets of an ocean’s force.<br>
Our conscious movements have sealed origins<br>
But with those shadowy seats no converse hold;<br>
No understanding binds our comrade parts;<br>
Our acts emerge from a crypt our minds ignore.<br>
Our deepest depths are ignorant of themselves;<br>
Even our body is a mystery shop;<br>
As our earth’s roots lurk screened below our earth,<br>
So lie unseen our roots of mind and life.<br>
Our springs are kept close hid beneath, within;<br>
Our souls are moved by powers behind the wall.<br>
In the subterranean reaches of the spirit<br>
A puissance acts and recks not what it means;<br>
Using unthinking monitors and scribes,<br>
It is the cause of what we think and feel.<br>
The troglodytes of the subconscious Mind,<br>
Ill-trained slow stammering interpreters<br>
Only of their small task’s routine aware<br>
And busy with the record in our cells,<br>

Concealed in the subliminal secrecies<br>
Mid an obscure occult machinery,<br>
Capture the mystic Morse whose measured lilt<br>
Transmits the messages of the cosmic Force.<br>
A whisper falls into life’s inner ear<br>
And echoes from the dun subconscient caves,<br>
Speech leaps, thought quivers, the heart vibrates, the will<br>
Answers and tissue and nerve obey the call.<br>
Our lives translate these subtle intimacies;<br>
All is the commerce of a secret Power.<br>
A thinking puppet is the mind of life:<br>
Its choice is the work of elemental strengths<br>
That know not their own birth and end and cause<br>
And glimpse not the immense intent they serve.<br>
In this nether life of man drab-hued and dull,<br>
Yet filled with poignant small ignoble things,<br>
The conscious Doll is pushed a hundred ways<br>
And feels the push but not the hands that drive.<br>
For none can see the masked ironic troupe<br>
To whom our figure-selves are marionettes,<br>
Our deeds unwitting movements in their grasp,<br>
Our passionate strife an entertainment’s scene.<br>
Ignorant themselves of their own fount of strength<br>
They play their part in the enormous whole.<br>
Agents of darkness imitating light,<br>
Spirits obscure and moving things obscure,<br>
Unwillingly they serve a mightier Power.<br>
Ananke’s engines organising Chance,<br>
Channels perverse of a stupendous Will,<br>
Tools of the Unknown who use us as their tools,<br>
Invested with power in Nature’s nether state,<br>
Into the actions mortals think their own<br>
They bring the incoherencies of Fate,<br>
Or make a doom of Time’s slipshod caprice<br>
And toss the lives of men from hand to hand<br>
In an inconsequent and devious game.<br>

<br>
Against all higher truth their stuff rebels;<br>
Only to Titan force their will lies prone.<br>
Inordinate their hold on human hearts,<br>
In all our nature’s turns they intervene.<br>
Insignificant architects of low-built lives<br>
And engineers of interest and desire,<br>
Out of crude earthiness and muddy thrills<br>
And coarse reactions of material nerve<br>
They build our huddled structures of self-will<br>
And the ill-lighted mansions of our thought,<br>
Or with the ego’s factories and marts<br>
Surround the beautiful temple of the soul.<br>
Artists minute of the hues of littleness,<br>
They set the mosaic of our comedy<br>
Or plan the trivial tragedy of our days,<br>
Arrange the deed, combine the circumstance<br>
And the fantasia of the moods costume.<br>
These unwise prompters of man’s ignorant heart<br>
And tutors of his stumbling speech and will,<br>
Movers of petty wraths and lusts and hates<br>
And changeful thoughts and shallow emotion’s starts,<br>
These slight illusion-makers with their masks,<br>
Painters of the decor of a dull-hued stage<br>
And nimble scene-shifters of the human play,<br>
Ever are busy with this ill-lit scene.<br>
Ourselves incapable to build our fate<br>
Only as actors speak and strut our parts<br>
Until the piece is done and we pass off<br>
Into a brighter Time and subtler Space.<br>
Thus they inflict their little pigmy law<br>
And curb the mounting slow uprise of man,<br>
Then his too scanty walk with death they close.<br>
This is the ephemeral creature’s daily life.<br>
As long as the human animal is lord<br>
And a dense nether nature screens the soul,<br>
<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
As long as intellect’s outward-gazing sight<br>
Serves earthy interest and creature joys,<br>
An incurable littleness pursues his days.<br>
Ever since consciousness was born on earth,<br>
Life is the same in insect, ape and man,<br>
Its stuff unchanged, its way the common route.<br>
If new designs, if richer details grow<br>
And thought is added and more tangled cares,<br>
If little by little it wears a brighter face,<br>
Still even in man the plot is mean and poor.<br>
A gross content prolongs his fallen state;<br>
His small successes are failures of the soul,<br>
His little pleasures punctuate frequent griefs:<br>
Hardship and toil are the heavy price he pays<br>
For the right to live and his last wages death.<br>
An inertia sunk towards inconscience,<br>
A sleep that imitates death is his repose.<br>
A puny splendour of creative force<br>
Is made his spur to fragile human works<br>
Which yet outlast their brief creator’s breath.<br>
He dreams sometimes of the revels of the gods<br>
And sees the Dionysian gesture pass, —<br>
A leonine greatness that would tear his soul<br>
If through his failing limbs and fainting heart<br>
The sweet and joyful mighty madness swept:<br>
Trivial amusements stimulate and waste<br>
The energy given to him to grow and be.<br>
His little hour is spent in little things.<br>
A brief companionship with many jars,<br>
A little love and jealousy and hate,<br>
A touch of friendship mid indifferent crowds<br>
Draw his heart-plan on life’s diminutive map.<br>
If something great awakes, too frail his pitch<br>
To reveal its zenith tension of delight,<br>
His thought to eternise its ephemeral soar,<br>
Art’s brilliant gleam is a pastime for his eyes,<br>
<br>
164<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Godheads of the Little Life<br>
<br>
A thrill that smites the nerves is music’s spell.<br>
Amidst his harassed toil and welter of cares,<br>
Pressed by the labour of his crowding thoughts,<br>
He draws sometimes around his aching brow<br>
Nature’s calm mighty hands to heal his life-pain.<br>
He is saved by her silence from his rack of self;<br>
In her tranquil beauty is his purest bliss.<br>
A new life dawns, he looks out from vistas wide;<br>
The Spirit’s breath moves him but soon retires:<br>
His strength was not made to hold that puissant guest.<br>
All dulls down to convention and routine<br>
Or a fierce excitement brings him vivid joys:<br>
His days are tinged with the red hue of strife<br>
And lust’s hot glare and passion’s crimson stain;<br>
Battle and murder are his tribal game.<br>
Time has he none to turn his eyes within<br>
And look for his lost self and his dead soul.<br>
His motion on too short an axis wheels;<br>
He cannot soar but creeps on his long road<br>
Or if, impatient of the trudge of Time,<br>
He would make a splendid haste on Fate’s slow road,<br>
His heart that runs soon pants and tires and sinks;<br>
Or he walks ever on and finds no end.<br>
Hardly a few can climb to greater life.<br>
All tunes to a low scale and conscious pitch.<br>
His knowledge dwells in the house of Ignorance;<br>
His force nears not even once the Omnipotent,<br>
Rare are his visits of heavenly ecstasy.<br>
The bliss which sleeps in things and tries to wake,<br>
Breaks out in him in a small joy of life:<br>
This scanty grace is his persistent stay;<br>
It lightens the burden of his many ills<br>
And reconciles him to his little world.<br>
He is satisfied with his common average kind;<br>
Tomorrow’s hopes and his old rounds of thought,<br>
His old familiar interests and desires<br>

<br>
He has made into a thick and narrowing hedge<br>
Defending his small life from the Invisible;<br>
His being’s kinship to infinity<br>
He has shut away from him into inmost self,<br>
Fenced off the greatnesses of hidden God.<br>
His being was formed to play a trivial part<br>
In a little drama on a petty stage;<br>
In a narrow plot he has pitched his tent of life<br>
Beneath the wide gaze of the starry Vast.<br>
He is the crown of all that has been done:<br>
Thus is creation’s labour justified;<br>
This is the world’s result, Nature’s last poise!<br>
And if this were all and nothing more were meant,<br>
If what now seems were the whole of what must be,<br>
If this were not a stade through which we pass<br>
On our road from Matter to eternal Self,<br>
To the Light that made the worlds, the Cause of things,<br>
Well might interpret our mind’s limited view<br>
Existence as an accident in Time,<br>
Illusion or phenomenon or freak,<br>
The paradox of a creative Thought<br>
Which moves between unreal opposites,<br>
Inanimate Force struggling to feel and know,<br>
Matter that chanced to read itself by Mind,<br>
Inconscience monstrously engendering soul.<br>
At times all looks unreal and remote:<br>
We seem to live in a fiction of our thoughts<br>
Pieced from sensation’s fanciful traveller’s tale,<br>
Or caught on the film of the recording brain,<br>
A figment or circumstance in cosmic sleep.<br>
A somnambulist walking under the moon,<br>
An image of ego treads through an ignorant dream<br>
Counting the moments of a spectral Time.<br>
In a false perspective of effect and cause,<br>
Trusting to a specious prospect of world-space,<br>
It drifts incessantly from scene to scene,<br>

<br>
Whither it knows not, to what fabulous verge.<br>
All here is dreamed or doubtfully exists,<br>
But who the dreamer is and whence he looks<br>
Is still unknown or only a shadowy guess.<br>
Or the world is real but ourselves too small,<br>
Insufficient for the mightiness of our stage.<br>
A thin life-curve crosses the titan whirl<br>
Of the orbit of a soulless universe,<br>
And in the belly of the sparse rolling mass<br>
A mind looks out from a small casual globe<br>
And wonders what itself and all things are.<br>
And yet to some interned subjective sight<br>
That strangely has formed in Matter’s sightless stuff,<br>
A pointillage minute of little self<br>
Takes figure as world-being’s conscious base.<br>
Such is our scene in the half-light below.<br>
This is the sign of Matter’s infinite,<br>
This the weird purport of the picture shown<br>
To Science the giantess, measurer of her field,<br>
As she pores on the record of her close survey<br>
And mathematises her huge external world,<br>
To Reason bound within the circle of sense,<br>
Or in Thought’s broad impalpable Exchange<br>
A speculator in tenuous vast ideas,<br>
Abstractions in the void her currency<br>
We know not with what firm values for its base.<br>
Only religion in this bankruptcy<br>
Presents its dubious riches to our hearts<br>
Or signs unprovisioned cheques on the Beyond:<br>
Our poverty shall there have its revenge.<br>
Our spirits depart discarding a futile life<br>
Into the blank unknown or with them take<br>
Death’s passport into immortality.<br>
Yet was this only a provisional scheme,<br>
A false appearance sketched by limiting sense,<br>

Mind’s insufficient self-discovery,<br>
An early attempt, a first experiment.<br>
This was a toy to amuse the infant earth;<br>
But knowledge ends not in these surface powers<br>
That live upon a ledge in the Ignorance<br>
And dare not look into the dangerous depths<br>
Or to stare upward measuring the Unknown.<br>
There is a deeper seeing from within<br>
And, when we have left these small purlieus of mind,<br>
A greater vision meets us on the heights<br>
In the luminous wideness of the spirit’s gaze.<br>
At last there wakes in us a witness Soul<br>
That looks at truths unseen and scans the Unknown;<br>
Then all assumes a new and marvellous face:<br>
The world quivers with a God-light at its core,<br>
In Time’s deep heart high purposes move and live,<br>
Life’s borders crumble and join infinity.<br>
This broad, confused, yet rigid scheme becomes<br>
A magnificent imbroglio of the Gods,<br>
A game, a work ambiguously divine.<br>
Our seekings are short-lived experiments<br>
Made by a wordless and inscrutable Power<br>
Testing its issues from inconscient Night<br>
To meet its luminous self of Truth and Bliss.<br>
It peers at the Real through the apparent form;<br>
It labours in our mortal mind and sense;<br>
Amid the figures of the Ignorance,<br>
In the symbol pictures drawn by word and thought,<br>
It seeks the truth to which all figures point;<br>
It looks for the source of Light with vision’s lamp;<br>
It works to find the Doer of all works,<br>
The unfelt Self within who is the guide,<br>
The unknown Self above who is the goal.<br>
All is not here a blinded Nature’s task:<br>
A Word, a Wisdom watches us from on high,<br>
A Witness sanctioning her will and works,<br>

An Eye unseen in the unseeing vast;<br>
There is an Influence from a Light above,<br>
There are thoughts remote and sealed eternities;<br>
A mystic motive drives the stars and suns.<br>
In this passage from a deaf unknowing Force<br>
To struggling consciousness and transient breath<br>
A mighty Supernature waits on Time.<br>
The world is other than we now think and see,<br>
Our lives a deeper mystery than we have dreamed;<br>
Our minds are starters in the race to God,<br>
Our souls deputed selves of the Supreme.<br>
Across the cosmic field through narrow lanes<br>
Asking a scanty dole from Fortune’s hands<br>
And garbed in beggar’s robes there walks the One.<br>
Even in the theatre of these small lives<br>
Behind the act a secret sweetness breathes,<br>
An urge of miniature divinity.<br>
A mystic passion from the wells of God<br>
Flows through the guarded spaces of the soul;<br>
A force that helps supports the suffering earth,<br>
An unseen nearness and a hidden joy.<br>
There are muffled throbs of laughter’s undertones,<br>
The murmur of an occult happiness,<br>
An exultation in the depths of sleep,<br>
A heart of bliss within a world of pain.<br>
An Infant nursed on Nature’s covert breast,<br>
An Infant playing in the magic woods,<br>
Fluting to rapture by the spirit’s streams,<br>
Awaits the hour when we shall turn to his call.<br>
In this investiture of fleshly life<br>
A soul that is a spark of God survives<br>
And sometimes it breaks through the sordid screen<br>
And kindles a fire that makes us half-divine.<br>
In our body’s cells there sits a hidden Power<br>
That sees the unseen and plans eternity,<br>
Our smallest parts have room for deepest needs;<br>

There too the golden Messengers can come:<br>
A door is cut in the mud wall of self;<br>
Across the lowly threshold with bowed heads<br>
Angels of ecstasy and self-giving pass,<br>
And lodged in an inner sanctuary of dream<br>
The makers of the image of deity live.<br>
Pity is there and fire-winged sacrifice,<br>
And flashes of sympathy and tenderness<br>
Cast heaven-lights from the heart’s secluded shrine.<br>
A work is done in the deep silences;<br>
A glory and wonder of spiritual sense,<br>
A laughter in beauty’s everlasting space<br>
Transforming world-experience into joy,<br>
Inhabit the mystery of the untouched gulfs;<br>
Lulled by Time’s beats eternity sleeps in us.<br>
In the sealed hermetic heart, the happy core,<br>
Unmoved behind this outer shape of death<br>
The eternal Entity prepares within<br>
Its matter of divine felicity,<br>
Its reign of heavenly phenomenon.<br>
Even in our sceptic mind of ignorance<br>
A foresight comes of some immense release,<br>
Our will lifts towards it slow and shaping hands.<br>
Each part in us desires its absolute.<br>
Our thoughts covet the everlasting Light,<br>
Our strength derives from an omnipotent Force,<br>
And since from a veiled God-joy the worlds were made<br>
And since eternal Beauty asks for form<br>
Even here where all is made of being’s dust,<br>
Our hearts are captured by ensnaring shapes,<br>
Our very senses blindly seek for bliss.<br>

To fill this image of our transience,<br>
All shall be captured by delight, transformed:<br>

Its cells sustain bright metamorphosis.<br>

Its shape of person and its ego-face<br>
Divested of this mortal travesty,<br>
Like a clay troll kneaded into a god<br>

In the red passion of its infinite change,<br>
Quiver, awake, and shudder with ecstasy.<br>
As if reversing a deformation’s spell,<br>
Released from the black magic of the Night,<br>
Renouncing servitude to the dim Abyss,<br>
It shall learn at last who lived within unseen,<br>
And seized with marvel in the adoring heart<br>
To the enthroned Child-Godhead kneel aware,<br>
Trembling with beauty and delight and love.<br>
But first the spirit’s ascent we must achieve<br>
Out of the chasm from which our nature rose.<br>

And climb to summits beyond mind’s half-sleep;<br>

Across the dangerous haze, the pregnant stir,<br>
He through the astral chaos shore a way<br>
Mid the grey faces of its demon gods,<br>
Questioned by whispers of its flickering ghosts,<br>
Besieged by sorceries of its fluent force.<br>
As one who walks unguided through strange fields<br>
Tending he knows not where nor with what hope,<br>
He trod a soil that failed beneath his feet<br>
And journeyed in stone strength to a fugitive end.<br>
His trail behind him was a vanishing line<br>
Of glimmering points in a vague immensity;<br>
A bodiless murmur travelled at his side<br>
In the wounded gloom complaining against light.<br>
A huge obstruction its immobile heart,<br>
The watching opacity multiplied as he moved<br>
Its hostile mass of dead and staring eyes;<br>
The darkness glimmered like a dying torch.<br>
Around him an extinguished phantom glow<br>
Peopled with shadowy and misleading shapes<br>
The vague Inconscient’s dark and measureless cave.<br>
His only sunlight was his spirit’s flame.<br>

Towards the far gleam of a tunnel’s mouth,<br>
Hoping for light, walks now with freer pace<br>
And feels approach a breath of wider air,<br>
So he escaped from that grey anarchy.<br>
Into an ineffectual world he came,<br>
A purposeless region of arrested birth<br>
Where being from non-being fled and dared<br>
To live but had no strength long to abide.<br>
Above there gleamed a pondering brow of sky<br>
Tormented, crossed by wings of doubtful haze<br>
Adventuring with a voice of roaming winds<br>
And crying for a direction in the void<br>
Like blind souls looking for the selves they lost<br>
And wandering through unfamiliar worlds;<br>
Wings of vague questioning met the query of Space.<br>
After denial dawned a dubious hope,<br>
A hope of self and form and leave to live<br>
And the birth of that which never yet could be,<br>
And joy of the mind’s hazard, the heart’s choice,<br>
Grace of the unknown and hands of sudden surprise<br>
And a touch of sure delight in unsure things:<br>
To a strange uncertain tract his journey came<br>
Where consciousness played with unconscious self<br>
And birth was an attempt or episode.<br>
A charm drew near that could not keep its spell,<br>
An eager Power that could not find its way,<br>
A Chance that chose a strange arithmetic<br>
But could not bind with it the forms it made,<br>
A multitude that could not guard its sum<br>
Which less than zero grew and more than one.<br>

Arriving at a large and shadowy sense<br>
That cared not to define its fleeting drift,<br>
Life laboured in a strange and mythic air<br>
Denuded of her sweet magnificent suns.<br>
In worlds imagined, never yet made true,<br>
A lingering glimmer on creation’s verge,<br>
One strayed and dreamed and never stopped to achieve:<br>
To achieve would have destroyed that magic Space.<br>
The marvels of a twilight wonderland<br>
Full of a beauty strangely, vainly made,<br>
A surge of fanciful realities,<br>
Dim tokens of a Splendour sealed above,<br>
Awoke the passion of the eyes’ desire,<br>
Compelled belief on the enamoured thought<br>
And drew the heart but led it to no goal.<br>
A magic flowed as if of moving scenes<br>
That kept awhile their fugitive delicacy<br>
Of sparing lines limned by an abstract art<br>
In a rare scanted light with faint dream-brush<br>
On a silver background of incertitude.<br>
An infant glow of heavens near to morn,<br>
A fire intense conceived but never lit,<br>
Caressed the air with ardent hints of day.<br>
The perfect longing for imperfection’s charm,<br>
The illumined caught by the snare of Ignorance,<br>
Ethereal creatures drawn by body’s lure<br>
To that region of promise, beating invisible wings,<br>
Came hungry for the joy of finite life<br>
But too divine to tread created soil<br>
And share the fate of perishable things.<br>
The Children of the unembodied Gleam<br>
Arisen from a formless thought in the soul<br>
And chased by an imperishable desire,<br>
Traversed the field of the pursuing gaze.<br>

Life was a search but finding never came.<br>

Things seemed to be that never wholly are,<br>
Images were seen that looked like living acts<br>
And symbols hid the sense they claimed to show,<br>
Pale dreams grew real to the dreamer’s eyes.<br>
The souls came there that vainly strive for birth,<br>
And spirits entrapped might wander through all time,<br>
Yet never find the truth by which they live.<br>
All ran like hopes that hunt a lurking chance;<br>
Nothing was solid, nothing felt complete:<br>
All was unsafe, miraculous and half-true.<br>
It seemed a realm of lives that had no base.<br>
Then dawned a greater seeking, broadened sky,<br>
A journey under wings of brooding Force.<br>
First came the kingdom of the morning star:<br>
A twilight beauty trembled under its spear<br>
And the throb of promise of a wider Life.<br>
Then slowly rose a great and doubting sun<br>
And in its light she made of self a world.<br>
A spirit was there that sought for its own deep self,<br>
Yet was content with fragments pushed in front<br>
And parts of living that belied the whole<br>
But, pieced together, might one day be true.<br>
Yet something seemed to be achieved at last.<br>
A growing volume of the will-to-be,<br>
A text of living and a graph of force,<br>
A script of acts, a song of conscious forms<br>
Burdened with meanings fugitive from thought’s grasp<br>
And crowded with undertones of life’s rhythmic cry,<br>
Could write itself on the hearts of living things.<br>
In an outbreak of the might of secret Spirit,<br>
In Life and Matter’s answer of delight,<br>
Some face of deathless beauty could be caught<br>
That gave immortality to a moment’s joy,<br>
Some word that could incarnate highest Truth<br>

<br>
Leaped out from a chance tension of the soul,<br>
Some hue of the Absolute could fall on life,<br>
Some glory of knowledge and intuitive sight,<br>
Some passion of the rapturous heart of Love.<br>
A hierophant of the bodiless Secrecy<br>
Interned in an unseen spiritual sheath,<br>
The Will that pushes sense beyond its scope<br>
To feel the light and joy intangible,<br>
Half found its way into the Ineffable’s peace,<br>
Half captured a sealed sweetness of desire<br>
That yearned from a bosom of mysterious Bliss,<br>
Half manifested veiled Reality.<br>
A soul not wrapped into its cloak of mind<br>
Could glimpse the true sense of a world of forms;<br>
Illumined by a vision in the thought,<br>
Upbuoyed by the heart’s understanding flame,<br>
It could hold in the conscious ether of the spirit<br>
The divinity of a symbol universe.<br>
This realm inspires us with our vaster hopes;<br>
Its forces have made landings on our globe,<br>
Its signs have traced their pattern in our lives:<br>
It lends a sovereign movement to our fate,<br>
Its errant waves motive our life’s high surge.<br>
All that we seek for is prefigured there<br>
And all we have not known nor ever sought<br>
Which yet one day must be born in human hearts<br>
That the Timeless may fulfil itself in things.<br>
Incarnate in the mystery of the days,<br>
Eternal in an unclosed Infinite,<br>
A mounting endless possibility<br>
Climbs high upon a topless ladder of dream<br>
For ever in the Being’s conscious trance.<br>
All on that ladder mounts to an unseen end.<br>
An Energy of perpetual transience makes<br>
The journey from which no return is sure,<br>
The pilgrimage of Nature to the Unknown.<br>

As if in her ascent to her lost source<br>
She hoped to unroll all that could ever be,<br>
Her high procession moves from stage to stage,<br>
A progress leap from sight to greater sight,<br>
A process march from form to ampler form,<br>
A caravan of the inexhaustible<br>
Formations of a boundless Thought and Force.<br>
Her timeless Power that lay once on the lap<br>
Of a beginningless and endless Calm,<br>
Now severed from the Spirit’s immortal bliss,<br>
Erects the type of all the joys she has lost;<br>
Compelling transient substance into shape,<br>
She hopes by the creative act’s release<br>
To o’erleap sometimes the gulf she cannot fill,<br>
To heal awhile the wound of severance,<br>
Escape from the moment’s prison of littleness<br>
And meet the Eternal’s wide sublimities<br>
In the uncertain time-field portioned here.<br>
Almost she nears what never can be attained;<br>
She shuts eternity into an hour<br>
And fills a little soul with the Infinite;<br>
The Immobile leans to the magic of her call;<br>
She stands on a shore in the Illimitable,<br>
Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms<br>
And feels around her infinity’s embrace.<br>
Her task no ending knows; she serves no aim<br>
But labours driven by a nameless Will<br>
That came from some unknowable formless Vast.<br>
This is her secret and impossible task<br>
To catch the boundless in a net of birth,<br>
To cast the spirit into physical form,<br>
To lend speech and thought to the Ineffable;<br>
She is pushed to reveal the ever Unmanifest.<br>
Yet by her skill the impossible has been done:<br>
She follows her sublime irrational plan,<br>
Invents devices of her magic art<br>

<br>
To find new bodies for the Infinite<br>
And images of the Unimaginable;<br>
She has lured the Eternal into the arms of Time.<br>
Even now herself she knows not what she has done.<br>
For all is wrought beneath a baffling mask:<br>
A semblance other than its hidden truth<br>
The aspect wears of an illusion’s trick,<br>
A feigned time-driven unreality,<br>
The unfinished creation of a changing soul<br>
In a body changing with the inhabitant.<br>
Insignificant her means, infinite her work;<br>
On a great field of shapeless consciousness<br>
In little finite strokes of mind and sense<br>
An endless Truth she endlessly unfolds;<br>
A timeless mystery works out in Time.<br>
The greatness she has dreamed her acts have missed,<br>
Her labour is a passion and a pain,<br>
A rapture and pang, her glory and her curse;<br>
And yet she cannot choose but labours on;<br>
Her mighty heart forbids her to desist.<br>
As long as the world lasts her failure lives<br>
Astonishing and foiling Reason’s gaze,<br>
A folly and a beauty unspeakable,<br>
A superb madness of the will to live,<br>
A daring, a delirium of delight.<br>
This is her being’s law, its sole resource;<br>
She sates, though satisfaction never comes,<br>
Her hungry will to lavish everywhere<br>
Her many-imaged fictions of the Self<br>
And thousand fashions of one Reality.<br>
A world she made touched by truth’s fleeing hem,<br>
A world cast into a dream of what it seeks,<br>
An icon of truth, a conscious mystery’s shape.<br>
It lingered not like the earth-mind hemmed in<br>
In solid barriers of apparent fact;<br>
It dared to trust the dream-mind and the soul.<br>

A hunter of spiritual verities<br>
Still only thought or guessed or held by faith,<br>
It seized in imagination and confined<br>
A painted bird of paradise in a cage.<br>
This greater life is enamoured of the Unseen;<br>
It calls to some highest Light beyond its reach,<br>
It can feel the Silence that absolves the soul;<br>
It feels a saviour touch, a ray divine:<br>
Beauty and good and truth its godheads are.<br>
It is near to heavenlier heavens than earth’s eyes see,<br>
A direr darkness than man’s life can bear:<br>
It has kinship with the demon and the god.<br>
A strange enthusiasm has moved its heart;<br>
It hungers for heights, it passions for the supreme.<br>
It hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape,<br>
It leaps to the summit thought, the summit light.<br>
For by the form the Formless is brought close<br>
And all perfection fringes the Absolute.<br>
A child of heaven who never saw his home,<br>
Its impetus meets the eternal at a point:<br>
It can only near and touch, it cannot hold;<br>
It can only strain towards some bright extreme:<br>
Its greatness is to seek and to create.<br>
On every plane, this Greatness must create.<br>
On earth, in heaven, in hell she is the same;<br>
Of every fate she takes her mighty part.<br>
A guardian of the fire that lights the suns,<br>
She triumphs in her glory and her might:<br>
Opposed, oppressed she bears God’s urge to be born:<br>
The spirit survives upon non-being’s ground,<br>
World-force outlasts world-disillusion’s shock:<br>
Dumb, she is still the Word, inert the Power.<br>
Here fallen, a slave of death and ignorance,<br>
To things deathless she is driven to aspire<br>
And moved to know even the Unknowable.<br>
Even nescient, null, her sleep creates a world.<br>

When most unseen, most mightily she works;<br>
Housed in the atom, buried in the clod,<br>
Her quick creative passion cannot cease.<br>
Inconscience is her long gigantic pause,<br>
Her cosmic swoon is a stupendous phase:<br>
Time-born, she hides her immortality;<br>
In death, her bed, she waits the hour to rise.<br>
Even with the Light denied that sent her forth<br>
And the hope dead she needed for her task,<br>
Even when her brightest stars are quenched in Night,<br>
Nourished by hardship and calamity<br>
And with pain for her body’s handmaid, masseuse, nurse,<br>
Her tortured invisible spirit continues still<br>
To toil though in darkness, to create though with pangs;<br>
She carries crucified God upon her breast.<br>
In chill insentient depths where joy is none,<br>
Immured, oppressed by the resisting Void<br>
Where nothing moves and nothing can become,<br>
Still she remembers, still invokes the skill<br>
The Wonder-worker gave her at her birth,<br>
Imparts to drowsy formlessness a shape,<br>
Reveals a world where nothing was before.<br>
In realms confined to a prone circle of death,<br>
To a dark eternity of Ignorance,<br>
A quiver in an inert inconscient mass,<br>
Or imprisoned in immobilised whorls of Force,<br>
By Matter’s blind compulsion deaf and mute<br>
She refuses motionless in the dust to sleep.<br>
Then, for her rebel waking’s punishment<br>
Given only hard mechanic Circumstance<br>
As the enginery of her magic craft,<br>
She fashions godlike marvels out of mud;<br>
In the plasm she sets her dumb immortal urge,<br>
Helps the live tissue to think, the closed sense to feel,<br>
Flashes through the frail nerves poignant messages,<br>
In a heart of flesh miraculously loves,<br>

To brute bodies gives a soul, a will, a voice.<br>
Ever she summons as by a sorcerer’s wand<br>
Beings and shapes and scenes innumerable,<br>
Torch-bearers of her pomps through Time and Space.<br>
This world is her long journey through the night,<br>
The suns and planets lamps to light her road,<br>
Our reason is the confidante of her thoughts,<br>
Our senses are her vibrant witnesses.<br>
There drawing her signs from things half true, half false,<br>
She labours to replace by realised dreams<br>
The memory of her lost eternity.<br>
These are her deeds in this huge world-ignorance:<br>
Till the veil is lifted, till the night is dead,<br>
In light or dark she keeps her tireless search;<br>
Time is her road of endless pilgrimage.<br>
One mighty passion motives all her works.<br>
Her eternal Lover is her action’s cause;<br>
For him she leaped forth from the unseen Vasts<br>
To move here in a stark unconscious world.<br>
Its acts are her commerce with her hidden Guest,<br>
His moods she takes for her heart’s passionate moulds;<br>
In beauty she treasures the sunlight of his smile.<br>
Ashamed of her rich cosmic poverty,<br>
She cajoles with her small gifts his mightiness,<br>
Holds with her scenes his look’s fidelity<br>
And woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell<br>
In figures of her million-impulsed Force.<br>
Only to attract her veiled companion<br>
And keep him close to her breast in her world-cloak<br>
Lest from her arms he turn to his formless peace,<br>
Is her heart’s business and her clinging care.<br>
Yet when he is most near, she feels him far.<br>
For contradiction is her nature’s law.<br>
Although she is ever in him and he in her,<br>
As if unaware of the eternal tie,<br>
Her will is to shut God into her works<br>

And keep him as her cherished prisoner<br>
That never they may part again in Time.<br>
A sumptuous chamber of the spirit’s sleep<br>
At first she made, a deep interior room,<br>
Where he slumbers as if a forgotten guest.<br>
But now she turns to break the oblivious spell,<br>
Awakes the sleeper on the sculptured couch;<br>
She finds again the Presence in the form<br>
And in the light that wakes with him recovers<br>
A meaning in the hurry and trudge of Time,<br>
And through this mind that once obscured the soul<br>
Passes a glint of unseen deity.<br>
Across a luminous dream of spirit-space<br>
She builds creation like a rainbow bridge<br>
Between the original Silence and the Void.<br>
A net is made of the mobile universe;<br>
She weaves a snare for the conscious Infinite.<br>
A knowledge is with her that conceals its steps<br>
And seems a mute omnipotent Ignorance.<br>
A might is with her that makes wonders true;<br>
The incredible is her stuff of common fact.<br>
Her purposes, her workings riddles prove;<br>
Examined, they grow other than they were,<br>
Explained, they seem yet more inexplicable.<br>
Even in our world a mystery has reigned<br>
Earth’s cunning screen of trivial plainness hides;<br>
Her larger levels are of sorceries made.<br>
There the enigma shows its splendid prism,<br>
There is no deep disguise of commonness;<br>
Occult, profound comes all experience,<br>
Marvel is ever new, miracle divine.<br>
There is a screened burden, a mysterious touch,<br>
There is a secrecy of hidden sense.<br>
Although no earthen mask weighs on her face,<br>
Into herself she flees from her own sight.<br>
All forms are tokens of some veiled idea<br>

Whose covert purpose lurks from mind’s pursuit,<br>
Yet is a womb of sovereign consequence.<br>
There every thought and feeling is an act,<br>
And every act a symbol and a sign,<br>
And every symbol hides a living power.<br>
A universe she builds from truths and myths,<br>
But what she needed most she cannot build;<br>
All shown is a figure or copy of the Truth,<br>
But the Real veils from her its mystic face.<br>
All else she finds, there lacks eternity;<br>
All is sought out, but missed the Infinite.<br>
A consciousness lit by a Truth above<br>
Was felt; it saw the light but not the Truth:<br>
It caught the Idea and built from it a world;<br>
It made an Image there and called it God.<br>
Yet something true and inward harboured there.<br>
The beings of that world of greater life,<br>
Tenants of a larger air and freer space,<br>
Live not by the body or in outward things:<br>
A deeper living was their seat of self.<br>
In that intense domain of intimacy<br>
Objects dwell as companions of the soul;<br>
The body’s actions are a minor script,<br>
The surface rendering of a life within.<br>
All forces are Life’s retinue in that world<br>
And thought and body as her handmaids move.<br>
The universal widenesses give her room:<br>
All feel the cosmic movement in their acts<br>
And are the instruments of her cosmic might.<br>
Or their own self they make their universe.<br>
In all who have risen to a greater Life,<br>
A voice of unborn things whispers to the ear,<br>
To their eyes visited by some high sunlight<br>
Aspiration shows the image of a crown:<br>
To work out a seed that she has thrown within,<br>

To achieve her power in them her creatures live.<br>
Each is a greatness growing towards the heights<br>
Or from his inner centre oceans out;<br>
In circling ripples of concentric power<br>
They swallow, glutted, their environment.<br>
Even of that largeness many a cabin make;<br>
In narrower breadths and briefer vistas pent<br>

To rule the little empire of themselves,<br>
To be a figure in their private world<br>
And make the milieu’s joys and griefs their own<br>

And marked their souls with her tremendous seal:<br>
Whatever Fate may do to them they have earned;<br>
Something they have done, something they have been, they live.<br>
There Matter is soul’s result and not its cause.<br>
In a contrary balance to earth’s truth of things<br>
The gross weighs less, the subtle counts for more;<br>
On inner values hangs the outer plan.<br>
As quivers with the thought the expressive word,<br>
As yearns the act with the passion of the soul<br>
This world’s apparent sensible design<br>
Looks vibrant back to some interior might.<br>
A Mind not limited by external sense<br>
Gave figures to the spirit’s imponderables,<br>
The world’s impacts without channels registered<br>
And turned into the body’s concrete thrill<br>
The vivid workings of a bodiless Force;<br>
Powers here subliminal that act unseen<br>
Or in ambush crouch waiting behind the wall<br>
Came out in front uncovering their face.<br>
The occult grew there overt, the obvious kept<br>
A covert turn and shouldered the unknown;<br>
The unseen was felt and jostled visible shapes.<br>
In the communion of two meeting minds<br>
Thought looked at thought and had no need of speech;<br>
Emotion clasped emotion in two hearts,<br>
They felt each other’s thrill in the flesh and nerves<br>
Or melted each in each and grew immense<br>
As when two houses burn and fire joins fire:<br>
Hate grappled hate and love broke in on love,<br>
Will wrestled with will on mind’s invisible ground;<br>
Others’ sensations passing through like waves<br>

Left quivering the subtle body’s frame,<br>
Their anger rushed galloping in brute attack,<br>
A charge of trampling hooves on shaken soil;<br>
One felt another’s grief invade the breast,<br>
Another’s joy exulting ran through the blood:<br>
Hearts could draw close through distance, voices near<br>
That spoke upon the shore of alien seas.<br>
There beat a throb of living interchange:<br>
Being felt being even when afar<br>
And consciousness replied to consciousness.<br>
And yet the ultimate oneness was not there.<br>
There was a separateness of soul from soul:<br>
An inner wall of silence could be built,<br>
An armour of conscious might protect and shield;<br>
The being could be closed in and solitary;<br>
One could remain apart in self, alone.<br>
Identity was not yet nor union’s peace.<br>
All was imperfect still, half-known, half-done:<br>
The miracle of Inconscience overpassed,<br>
The miracle of the Superconscient still,<br>
Unknown, self-wrapped, unfelt, unknowable,<br>
Looked down on them, origin of all they were.<br>
As forms they came of the formless Infinite,<br>
As names lived of a nameless Eternity.<br>
The beginning and the end were there occult;<br>
A middle term worked unexplained, abrupt:<br>
They were words that spoke to a vast wordless Truth,<br>
They were figures crowding an unfinished sum.<br>
None truly knew himself or knew the world<br>
Or the Reality living there enshrined:<br>
Only they knew what Mind could take and build<br>
Out of the secret Supermind’s huge store.<br>
A darkness under them, a bright Void above,<br>
Uncertain they lived in a great climbing Space;<br>
By mysteries they explained a Mystery,<br>
A riddling answer met the riddle of things.<br>

As he moved in this ether of ambiguous life,<br>
Himself was soon a riddle to himself;<br>
As symbols he saw all and sought their sense.<br>
Across the leaping springs of death and birth<br>
And over shifting borders of soul-change,<br>
A hunter on the spirit’s creative track,<br>
He followed in life’s fine and mighty trails<br>
Pursuing her sealed formidable delight<br>
In a perilous adventure without close.<br>
At first no aim appeared in those large steps:<br>
Only the wide source he saw of all things here<br>
Looking towards a wider source beyond.<br>
For as she drew away from earthly lines,<br>
A tenser drag was felt from the Unknown,<br>
A higher context of delivering thought<br>
Drove her towards marvel and discovery;<br>
There came a high release from pettier cares,<br>
A mightier image of desire and hope,<br>
A vaster formula, a greater scene.<br>
Ever she circled towards some far-off Light:<br>
Her signs still covered more than they revealed;<br>
But tied to some immediate sight and will<br>
They lost their purport in the joy of use,<br>
Till stripped of their infinite meaning they became<br>
A cipher gleaming with unreal sense.<br>
Armed with a magical and haunted bow<br>
She aimed at a target kept invisible<br>
And ever deemed remote though always near.<br>
As one who spells illumined characters,<br>
The key-book of a crabbed magician text,<br>
He scanned her subtle tangled weird designs<br>
And the screened difficult theorem of her clues,<br>

Read the Nō-gestures of her silhouettes,<br>
And strove to capture in their burdened drift<br>
The dance-fantasia of her sequences<br>
Escaping into rhythmic mystery,<br>
A glimmer of fugitive feet on fleeing soil.<br>
In the labyrinth pattern of her thoughts and hopes<br>
And the byways of her intimate desires,<br>
In the complex corners crowded with her dreams<br>
And rounds crossed by an intrigue of irrelevant rounds,<br>
A wanderer straying amid fugitive scenes,<br>
He lost its signs and chased each failing guess.<br>
Ever he met key-words, ignorant of their key.<br>
A sun that dazzled its own eye of sight,<br>
A luminous enigma’s brilliant hood<br>
Lit the dense purple barrier of thought’s sky:<br>
A dim large trance showed to the night her stars.<br>
As if sitting near an open window’s gap,<br>
He read by lightning-flash on crowding flash<br>
Chapters of her metaphysical romance<br>
Of the soul’s search for lost Reality<br>
And her fictions drawn from spirit’s authentic fact,<br>
Her caprices and conceits and meanings locked,<br>
Her rash unseizable freaks and mysteried turns.<br>
The magnificent wrappings of her secrecy<br>
That fold her desirable body out of sight,<br>
The strange significant forms woven on her robe,<br>
Her meaningful outlines of the souls of things<br>

Her rich brocades with imaged fancies sewn<br>
And mutable masks and broideries of disguise.<br>
A thousand baffling faces of the Truth<br>
Looked at him from her forms with unknown eyes<br>

Spoke from the figures of her masquerade,<br>
Or peered from the recondite magnificence<br>
And subtle splendour of her draperies.<br>

In sudden scintillations of the Unknown,<br>
Inexpressive sounds became veridical,<br>
Ideas that seemed unmeaning flashed out truth;<br>
Voices that came from unseen waiting worlds<br>
Uttered the syllables of the Unmanifest<br>
To clothe the body of the mystic Word,<br>
And wizard diagrams of the occult Law<br>
Sealed some precise unreadable harmony,<br>
Or used hue and figure to reconstitute<br>
The herald blazon of Time’s secret things.<br>
In her green wildernesses and lurking depths,<br>
In her thickets of joy where danger clasps delight,<br>
He glimpsed the hidden wings of her songster hopes,<br>
A glimmer of blue and gold and scarlet fire.<br>
In her covert lanes, bordering her chance field-paths<br>
And by her singing rivulets and calm lakes<br>
He found the glow of her golden fruits of bliss<br>
And the beauty of her flowers of dream and muse.<br>
As if a miracle of heart’s change by joy<br>
He watched in the alchemist radiance of her suns<br>
The crimson outburst of one secular flower<br>
On the tree-of-sacrifice of spiritual love.<br>
In the sleepy splendour of her noons he saw,<br>
A perpetual repetition through the hours,<br>
Thought’s dance of dragonflies on mystery’s stream<br>
That skim but never test its murmurs’ race,<br>
And heard the laughter of her rose desires<br>
Running as if to escape from longed-for hands,<br>
Jingling sweet anklet-bells of fantasy.<br>
Amidst live symbols of her occult power<br>
He moved and felt them as close real forms:<br>
In that life more concrete than the lives of men<br>
Throbbed heart-beats of the hidden reality:<br>
Embodied was there what we but think and feel,<br>
Self-framed what here takes outward borrowed shapes.<br>
A comrade of Silence on her austere heights<br>

<br>
Accepted by her mighty loneliness,<br>
He stood with her on meditating peaks<br>
Where life and being are a sacrament<br>
Offered to the Reality beyond,<br>
And saw her loose into infinity<br>
Her hooded eagles of significance,<br>
Messengers of Thought to the Unknowable.<br>
Identified in soul-vision and soul-sense,<br>
Entering into her depths as into a house,<br>
All he became that she was or longed to be,<br>
He thought with her thoughts and journeyed with her steps,<br>
Lived with her breath and scanned all with her eyes<br>
That so he might learn the secret of her soul.<br>
A witness overmastered by his scene,<br>
He admired her splendid front of pomp and play<br>
And the marvels of her rich and delicate craft,<br>
And thrilled to the insistence of her cry;<br>
Impassioned he bore the sorceries of her might,<br>
Felt laid on him her abrupt mysterious will,<br>
Her hands that knead fate in their violent grasp,<br>
Her touch that moves, her powers that seize and drive.<br>
But this too he saw, her soul that wept within,<br>
Her seekings vain that clutch at fleeing truth,<br>
Her hopes whose sombre gaze mates with despair,<br>
The passion that possessed her longing limbs,<br>
The trouble and rapture of her yearning breasts,<br>
Her mind that toils unsatisfied with its fruits,<br>
Her heart that captures not the one Beloved.<br>
Always he met a veiled and seeking Force,<br>
An exiled goddess building mimic heavens,<br>
A Sphinx whose eyes look up to a hidden Sun.<br>
Ever he felt near a spirit in her forms:<br>
Its passive presence was her nature’s strength;<br>
This sole is real in apparent things,<br>
Even upon earth the spirit is life’s key,<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
But her solid outsides nowhere bear its trace.<br>
Its stamp on her acts is undiscoverable.<br>
A pathos of lost heights is its appeal.<br>
Only sometimes is caught a shadowy line<br>
That seems a hint of veiled reality.<br>
Life stared at him with vague confused outlines<br>
Offering a picture the eyes could not keep,<br>
A story that was yet not written there.<br>
As in a fragmentary half-lost design<br>
Life’s meanings fled from the pursuing eye.<br>
Life’s visage hides life’s real self from sight;<br>
Life’s secret sense is written within, above.<br>
The thought that gives it sense lives far beyond;<br>
It is not seen in its half-finished design.<br>
In vain we hope to read the baffling signs<br>
Or find the word of the half-played charade.<br>
Only in that greater life a cryptic thought<br>
Is found, is hinted some interpreting word<br>
That makes the earth-myth a tale intelligible.<br>
Something was seen at last that looked like truth.<br>
In a half-lit air of hazardous mystery<br>
The eye that looks at the dark half of truth<br>
Made out an image mid a vivid blur<br>
And peering through a mist of subtle tints<br>
He saw a half-blind chained divinity<br>
Bewildered by the world in which he moved,<br>
Yet conscious of some light prompting his soul.<br>
Attracted to strange far-off shimmerings,<br>
Led by the fluting of a distant Player<br>
He sought his way amid life’s laughter and call<br>
And the index chaos of her myriad steps<br>
Towards some total deep infinitude.<br>
Around crowded the forest of her signs:<br>
At hazard he read by arrow-leaps of Thought<br>
That hit the mark by guess or luminous chance,<br>
Her changing coloured road-lights of idea<br>
<br>
192<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Life<br>
<br>
And her signals of uncertain swift event,<br>
The hieroglyphs of her symbol pageantries<br>
And her landmarks in the tangled paths of Time.<br>
In her mazes of approach and of retreat<br>
To every side she draws him and repels,<br>
But drawn too near escapes from his embrace;<br>
All ways she leads him but no way is sure.<br>
Allured by the many-toned marvel of her chant,<br>
Attracted by the witchcraft of her moods<br>
And moved by her casual touch to joy and grief,<br>
He loses himself in her but wins her not.<br>
A fugitive paradise smiles at him from her eyes:<br>
He dreams of her beauty made for ever his,<br>
He dreams of his mastery her limbs shall bear,<br>
He dreams of the magic of her breasts of bliss.<br>
In her illumined script, her fanciful<br>
Translation of God’s pure original text,<br>
He thinks to read the Scripture Wonderful,<br>
Hieratic key to unknown beatitudes.<br>
But the Word of Life is hidden in its script,<br>
The chant of Life has lost its divine note.<br>
Unseen, a captive in a house of sound,<br>
The spirit lost in the splendour of a dream<br>
Listens to a thousand-voiced illusion’s ode.<br>
A delicate weft of sorcery steals the heart<br>
Or a fiery magic tints her tones and hues,<br>
Yet they but wake a thrill of transient grace;<br>
A vagrant march struck by the wanderer Time,<br>
They call to a brief unsatisfied delight<br>
Or wallow in ravishments of mind and sense,<br>
But miss the luminous answer of the soul.<br>
A blind heart-throb that reaches joy through tears,<br>
A yearning towards peaks for ever unreached,<br>
An ecstasy of unfulfilled desire<br>
Track the last heavenward climbings of her voice.<br>
Transmuted are past suffering’s memories<br>
<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Into an old sadness’s sweet escaping trail:<br>
Turned are her tears to gems of diamond pain,<br>
Her sorrow into a magic crown of song.<br>
Brief are her snatches of felicity<br>
That touch the surface, then escape or die:<br>
A lost remembrance echoes in her depths,<br>
A deathless longing is hers, a veiled self’s call;<br>
A prisoner in the mortal’s limiting world,<br>
A spirit wounded by life sobs in her breast;<br>
A cherished suffering is her deepest cry.<br>
A wanderer on forlorn despairing routes,<br>
Along the roads of sound a frustrate voice<br>
Forsaken cries to a forgotten bliss.<br>
Astray in the echo caverns of Desire,<br>
It guards the phantoms of a soul’s dead hopes<br>
And keeps alive the voice of perished things<br>
Or lingers upon sweet and errant notes<br>
Hunting for pleasure in the heart of pain.<br>
A fateful hand has touched the cosmic chords<br>
And the intrusion of a troubled strain<br>
Covers the inner music’s hidden key<br>
That guides unheard the surface cadences.<br>
Yet is it joy to live and to create<br>
And joy to love and labour though all fails,<br>
And joy to seek though all we find deceives<br>
And all on which we lean betrays our trust;<br>
Yet something in its depths was worth the pain,<br>
A passionate memory haunts with ecstasy’s fire.<br>
Even grief has joy hidden beneath its roots:<br>
For nothing is truly vain the One has made:<br>
In our defeated hearts God’s strength survives<br>
And victory’s star still lights our desperate road;<br>
Our death is made a passage to new worlds.<br>
This to Life’s music gives its anthem swell.<br>
To all she lends the glory of her voice;<br>
Heaven’s raptures whisper to her heart and pass,<br>
<br>

CANTO VI: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Life<br>
<br>
Earth’s transient yearnings cry from her lips and fade.<br>
Alone the God-given hymn escapes her art<br>
That came with her from her spiritual home<br>
But stopped half-way and failed, a silent word<br>
Awake in some deep pause of waiting worlds,<br>
A murmur suspended in eternity’s hush:<br>
But no breath comes from the supernal peace:<br>
A sumptuous interlude occupies the ear<br>
And the heart listens and the soul consents;<br>
An evanescent music it repeats<br>
Wasting on transience Time’s eternity.<br>
A tremolo of the voices of the hours<br>
Oblivious screens the high intended theme<br>
The self-embodying spirit came to play<br>
On the vast clavichord of Nature-Force.<br>
Only a mighty murmur here and there<br>
Of the eternal Word, the blissful Voice<br>
Or Beauty’s touch transfiguring heart and sense,<br>
A wandering splendour and a mystic cry,<br>
Recalls the strength and sweetness heard no more.<br>
Here is the gap, here stops or sinks life’s force;<br>
This deficit paupers the magician’s skill:<br>
This want makes all the rest seem thin and bare.<br>
A half-sight draws the horizon of her acts:<br>
Her depths remember what she came to do,<br>
But the mind has forgotten or the heart mistakes:<br>
In Nature’s endless lines is lost the God.<br>
In knowledge to sum up omniscience,<br>
In action to erect the Omnipotent,<br>
To create her Creator here was her heart’s conceit,<br>
To invade the cosmic scene with utter God.<br>
Toiling to transform the still far Absolute<br>
Into an all-fulfilling epiphany,<br>
Into an utterance of the Ineffable,<br>
She would bring the glory here of the Absolute’s force,<br>

Change poise into creation’s rhythmic swing,<br>
Marry with a sky of calm a sea of bliss.<br>
A fire to call eternity into Time,<br>
Make body’s joy as vivid as the soul’s,<br>
Earth she would lift to neighbourhood with heaven,<br>
Labours life to equate with the Supreme<br>
And reconcile the Eternal and the Abyss.<br>
Her pragmatism of the transcendent Truth<br>
Fills silence with the voices of the gods,<br>
But in the cry the single Voice is lost.<br>
For Nature’s vision climbs beyond her acts.<br>
A life of gods in heaven she sees above,<br>
A demigod emerging from an ape<br>
Is all she can in our mortal element.<br>
Here the half-god, the half-titan are her peak:<br>
This greater life wavers twixt earth and sky.<br>
A poignant paradox pursues her dreams:<br>
Her hooded energy moves an ignorant world<br>
To look for a joy her own strong clasp puts off:<br>
In her embrace it cannot turn to its source.<br>
Immense her power, endless her act’s vast drive,<br>
Astray is its significance and lost.<br>
Although she carries in her secret breast<br>
The law and journeying curve of all things born<br>
Her knowledge partial seems, her purpose small;<br>
On a soil of yearning tread her sumptuous hours.<br>
A leaden Nescience weighs the wings of Thought,<br>
Her power oppresses the being with its garbs,<br>
Her actions prison its immortal gaze.<br>
A sense of limit haunts her masteries<br>
And nowhere is assured content or peace:<br>
For all the depth and beauty of her work<br>
A wisdom lacks that sets the spirit free.<br>
An old and faded charm had now her face<br>
And palled for him her quick and curious lore;<br>
His wide soul asked a deeper joy than hers.<br>

<br>
Out of her daedal lines he sought escape;<br>
But neither gate of horn nor ivory<br>
He found nor postern of spiritual sight,<br>
There was no issue from that dreamlike space.<br>
Our being must move eternally through Time;<br>
Death helps us not, vain is the hope to cease;<br>
A secret Will compels us to endure.<br>
Our life’s repose is in the Infinite;<br>
It cannot end, its end is Life supreme.<br>
Death is a passage, not the goal of our walk:<br>
Some ancient deep impulsion labours on:<br>
Our souls are dragged as with a hidden leash,<br>
Carried from birth to birth, from world to world,<br>
Our acts prolong after the body’s fall<br>
The old perpetual journey without pause.<br>
No silent peak is found where Time can rest.<br>
This was a magic stream that reached no sea.<br>
However far he went, wherever turned,<br>
The wheel of works ran with him and outstripped;<br>
Always a farther task was left to do.<br>
A beat of action and a cry of search<br>
For ever grew in that unquiet world;<br>
A busy murmur filled the heart of Time.<br>
All was contrivance and unceasing stir.<br>
A hundred ways to live were tried in vain:<br>
A sameness that assumed a thousand forms<br>
Strove to escape from its long monotone<br>
And made new things that soon were like the old.<br>
A curious decoration lured the eye<br>
And novel values furbished ancient themes<br>
To cheat the mind with the idea of change.<br>
A different picture that was still the same<br>
Appeared upon the cosmic vague background.<br>
Only another labyrinthine house<br>
Of creatures and their doings and events,<br>
A city of the traffic of bound souls,<br>
<br>
197<br>

A market of creation and her wares,<br>
Was offered to the labouring mind and heart.<br>
A circuit ending where it first began<br>
Is dubbed the forward and eternal march<br>
Of progress on perfection’s unknown road.<br>
Each final scheme leads to a sequel plan.<br>
Yet every new departure seems the last,<br>
Inspired evangel, theory’s ultimate peak,<br>
Proclaiming a panacea for all Time’s ills<br>
Or carrying thought in its ultimate zenith flight<br>
And trumpeting supreme discovery;<br>
Each brief idea, a structure perishable,<br>
Publishes the immortality of its rule,<br>
Its claim to be the perfect form of things,<br>
Truth’s last epitome, Time’s golden best.<br>
But nothing has been achieved of infinite worth:<br>
A world made ever anew, never complete,<br>
Piled always half-attempts on lost attempts<br>
And saw a fragment as the eternal Whole.<br>
In the aimless mounting total of things done<br>
Existence seemed a vain necessity’s act,<br>
A wrestle of eternal opposites<br>
In a clasped antagonism’s close-locked embrace,<br>
A play without denouement or idea,<br>
A hunger march of lives without a goal,<br>
Or, written on a bare blackboard of Space,<br>
A futile and recurring sum of souls,<br>
A hope that failed, a light that never shone,<br>
The labour of an unaccomplished Force<br>
Tied to its acts in a dim eternity.<br>
There is no end or none can yet be seen:<br>
Although defeated, life must struggle on;<br>
Always she sees a crown she cannot grasp;<br>
Her eyes are fixed beyond her fallen state.<br>
There quivers still within her breast and ours<br>
A glory that was once and is no more,<br>

Or there calls to us from some unfulfilled beyond<br>
A greatness yet unreached by the halting world.<br>
In a memory behind our mortal sense<br>
A dream persists of larger happier air<br>
Breathing around free hearts of joy and love,<br>
Forgotten by us, immortal in lost Time.<br>
A ghost of bliss pursues her haunted depths;<br>
For she remembers still, though now so far,<br>
Her realm of golden ease and glad desire<br>
And the beauty and strength and happiness that were hers<br>
In the sweetness of her glowing paradise,<br>
In her kingdom of immortal ecstasy<br>
Half-way between God’s silence and the Abyss.<br>
This knowledge in our hidden parts we keep;<br>
Awake to a vague mystery’s appeal,<br>
We meet a deep unseen Reality<br>
Far truer than the world’s face of present truth:<br>
We are chased by a self we cannot now recall<br>
And moved by a Spirit we must still become.<br>
As one who has lost the kingdom of his soul,<br>
We look back to some god-phase of our birth<br>
Other than this imperfect creature here<br>
And hope in this or a diviner world<br>
To recover yet from Heaven’s patient guard<br>
What by our mind’s forgetfulness we miss,<br>
Our being’s natural felicity,<br>
Our heart’s delight we have exchanged for grief,<br>
The body’s thrill we bartered for mere pain,<br>
The bliss for which our mortal nature yearns<br>
As yearns an obscure moth to blazing Light.<br>
Our life is a march to a victory never won.<br>
This wave of being longing for delight,<br>
This eager turmoil of unsatisfied strengths,<br>
These long far files of forward-striving hopes<br>
Lift worshipping eyes to the blue Void called heaven<br>
Looking for the golden Hand that never came,<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
The advent for which all creation waits,<br>
The beautiful visage of Eternity<br>
That shall appear upon the roads of Time.<br>
Yet still to ourselves we say rekindling faith,<br>
“Oh, surely one day he shall come to our cry,<br>
One day he shall create our life anew<br>
And utter the magic formula of peace<br>
And bring perfection to the scheme of things.<br>
One day he shall descend to life and earth,<br>
Leaving the secrecy of the eternal doors,<br>
Into a world that cries to him for help,<br>
And bring the truth that sets the spirit free,<br>
The joy that is the baptism of the soul,<br>
The strength that is the outstretched arm of Love.<br>
One day he shall lift his beauty’s dreadful veil,<br>
Impose delight on the world’s beating heart<br>
And bare his secret body of light and bliss.”<br>
But now we strain to reach an unknown goal:<br>
There is no end of seeking and of birth,<br>
There is no end of dying and return;<br>
The life that wins its aim asks greater aims,<br>
The life that fails and dies must live again;<br>
Till it has found itself it cannot cease.<br>
All must be done for which life and death were made.<br>
But who shall say that even then is rest?<br>
Or there repose and action are the same<br>
In the deep breast of God’s supreme delight.<br>
In a high state where ignorance is no more,<br>
Each movement is a wave of peace and bliss,<br>
Repose God’s motionless creative force,<br>
Action a ripple in the Infinite<br>
And birth a gesture of Eternity.<br>
A sun of transfiguration still can shine<br>
And Night can bare its core of mystic light;<br>
The self-cancelling, self-afflicting paradox<br>
Into a self-luminous mystery might change,<br>

<br>
The imbroglio into a joyful miracle.<br>
Then God could be visible here, here take a shape;<br>
Disclosed would be the spirit’s identity;<br>
Life would reveal her true immortal face.<br>
But now a termless labour is her fate:<br>
In its recurrent decimal of events<br>
Birth, death are a ceaseless iteration’s points;<br>
The old question-mark margins each finished page,<br>
Each volume of her effort’s history.<br>
A limping Yes through the aeons journeys still<br>
Accompanied by an eternal No.<br>
All seems in vain, yet endless is the game.<br>
Impassive turns the ever-circling Wheel,<br>
Life has no issue, death brings no release.<br>
A prisoner of itself the being lives<br>
And keeps its futile immortality;<br>
Extinction is denied, its sole escape.<br>
An error of the gods has made the world.<br>
Or indifferent the Eternal watches Time.<br>

<br>
The Descent into Night<br>
A MIND absolved from life, made calm to know,<br>
A heart divorced from the blindness and the pang,<br>
The seal of tears, the bond of ignorance,<br>
He turned to find that wide world-failure’s cause.<br>
Away he looked from Nature’s visible face<br>
And sent his gaze into the viewless Vast,<br>
The formidable unknown Infinity,<br>
Asleep behind the endless coil of things,<br>
That carries the universe in its timeless breadths<br>
And the ripples of its being are our lives.<br>
The worlds are built by its unconscious Breath<br>
And Matter and Mind are its figures or its powers,<br>
Our waking thoughts the output of its dreams.<br>
The veil was rent that covers Nature’s depths:<br>
He saw the fount of the world’s lasting pain<br>
And the mouth of the black pit of Ignorance;<br>
The evil guarded at the roots of life<br>
Raised up its head and looked into his eyes.<br>
On a dim bank where dies subjective Space,<br>
From a stark ridge overlooking all that is,<br>
A tenebrous awakened Nescience,<br>
Her wide blank eyes wondering at Time and Form,<br>
Stared at the inventions of the living Void<br>
And the Abyss whence our beginnings rose.<br>
Behind appeared a grey carved mask of Night<br>
Watching the birth of all created things.<br>
A hidden Puissance conscious of its force,<br>
A vague and lurking Presence everywhere,<br>
A contrary Doom that threatens all things made,<br>
A Death figuring as the dark seed of life,<br>
Seemed to engender and to slay the world.<br>
<br>
CANTO VII: The Descent into Night<br>
<br>

<br>
Then from the sombre mystery of the gulfs<br>
And from the hollow bosom of the Mask<br>
Something crept forth that seemed a shapeless Thought.<br>
A fatal Influence upon creatures stole<br>
Whose lethal touch pursued the immortal spirit,<br>
On life was laid the haunting finger of death<br>
And overcast with error, grief and pain<br>
The soul’s native will for truth and joy and light.<br>
A deformation coiled that claimed to be<br>
The being’s very turn, Nature’s true drive.<br>
A hostile and perverting Mind at work<br>
In every corner ensconced of conscious life<br>
Corrupted Truth with her own formulas;<br>
Interceptor of the listening of the soul,<br>
Afflicting knowledge with the hue of doubt<br>
It captured the oracles of the occult gods,<br>
Effaced the signposts of Life’s pilgrimage,<br>
Cancelled the firm rock-edicts graved by Time,<br>
And on the foundations of the cosmic Law<br>
Erected its bronze pylons of misrule.<br>
Even Light and Love by that cloaked danger’s spell<br>
Turned from the brilliant nature of the gods<br>
To fallen angels and misleading suns,<br>
Became themselves a danger and a charm,<br>
A perverse sweetness, heaven-born malefice:<br>
Its power could deform divinest things.<br>
A wind of sorrow breathed upon the world;<br>
All thought with falsehood was besieged, all act<br>
Stamped with defect or with frustration’s sign,<br>
All high attempt with failure or vain success,<br>
But none could know the reason of his fall.<br>
The grey Mask whispered and, though no sound was heard,<br>
Yet in the ignorant heart a seed was sown<br>
That bore black fruit of suffering, death and bale.<br>
Out of the chill steppes of a bleak Unseen<br>
Invisible, wearing the Night’s grey mask,<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Arrived the shadowy dreadful messengers,<br>
Invaders from a dangerous world of power,<br>
Ambassadors of evil’s absolute.<br>
In silence the inaudible voices spoke,<br>
Hands that none saw planted the fatal grain,<br>
No form was seen, yet a dire work was done,<br>
An iron decree in crooked uncials written<br>
Imposed a law of sin and adverse fate.<br>
Life looked at him with changed and sombre eyes:<br>
Her beauty he saw and the yearning heart in things<br>
That with a little happiness is content,<br>
Answering to a small ray of truth or love;<br>
He saw her gold sunlight and her far blue sky,<br>
Her green of leaves and hue and scent of flowers<br>
And the charm of children and the love of friends<br>
And the beauty of women and kindly hearts of men,<br>
But saw too the dreadful Powers that drive her moods<br>
And the anguish she has strewn upon her ways,<br>
Fate waiting on the unseen steps of men<br>
And her evil and sorrow and last gift of death.<br>
A breath of disillusion and decadence<br>
Corrupting watched for Life’s maturity<br>
And made to rot the full grain of the soul:<br>
Progress became a purveyor of Death.<br>
A world that clung to the law of a slain Light<br>
Cherished the putrid corpses of dead truths,<br>
Hailed twisted forms as things free, new and true,<br>
Beauty from ugliness and evil drank<br>
Feeling themselves guests at a banquet of the gods<br>
And tasted corruption like a high-spiced food.<br>
A darkness settled on the heavy air;<br>
It hunted the bright smile from Nature’s lips<br>
And slew the native confidence in her heart<br>
And put fear’s crooked look into her eyes.<br>
The lust that warps the spirit’s natural good<br>
Replaced by a manufactured virtue and vice<br>
<br>

CANTO VII: The Descent into Night<br>
<br>
The frank spontaneous impulse of the soul:<br>
Afflicting Nature with the dual’s lie,<br>
Their twin values whetted a forbidden zest,<br>
Made evil a relief from spurious good,<br>
The ego battened on righteousness and sin<br>
And each became an instrument of Hell.<br>
In rejected heaps by a monotonous road<br>
The old simple delights were left to lie<br>
On the wasteland of life’s descent to Night.<br>
All glory of life was dimmed, tarnished with doubt;<br>
All beauty ended in an aging face;<br>
All power was dubbed a tyranny cursed by God<br>
And Truth a fiction needed by the mind:<br>
The chase of joy was now a tired hunt;<br>
All knowledge was left a questioning Ignorance.<br>
As from a womb obscure he saw emerge<br>
The body and visage of a dark Unseen<br>
Hidden behind the fair outsides of life.<br>
Its dangerous commerce is our suffering’s cause.<br>
Its breath is a subtle poison in men’s hearts;<br>
All evil starts from that ambiguous face.<br>
A peril haunted now the common air;<br>
The world grew full of menacing Energies,<br>
And wherever turned for help or hope his eyes,<br>
In field and house, in street and camp and mart<br>
He met the prowl and stealthy come and go<br>
Of armed disquieting bodied Influences.<br>
A march of goddess figures dark and nude<br>
Alarmed the air with grandiose unease;<br>
Appalling footsteps drew invisibly near,<br>
Shapes that were threats invaded the dream-light,<br>
And ominous beings passed him on the road<br>
Whose very gaze was a calamity:<br>
A charm and sweetness sudden and formidable,<br>
Faces that raised alluring lips and eyes<br>

Approached him armed with beauty like a snare,<br>
But hid a fatal meaning in each line<br>
And could in a moment dangerously change.<br>
But he alone discerned that screened attack.<br>
A veil upon the inner vision lay,<br>
A force was there that hid its dreadful steps;<br>
All was belied, yet thought itself the truth;<br>
All were beset but knew not of the siege:<br>
For none could see the authors of their fall.<br>
Aware of some dark wisdom still withheld<br>
That was the seal and warrant of this strength,<br>
He followed the track of dim tremendous steps<br>
Returning to the night from which they came.<br>
A tract he reached unbuilt and owned by none:<br>
There all could enter but none stay for long.<br>
It was a no man’s land of evil air,<br>
A crowded neighbourhood without one home,<br>
A borderland between the world and hell.<br>
There unreality was Nature’s lord:<br>
It was a space where nothing could be true,<br>
For nothing was what it had claimed to be:<br>
A high appearance wrapped a specious void.<br>
Yet nothing would confess its own pretence<br>
Even to itself in the ambiguous heart:<br>
A vast deception was the law of things;<br>
Only by that deception they could live.<br>
An unsubstantial Nihil guaranteed<br>
The falsehood of the forms this Nature took<br>
And made them seem awhile to be and live.<br>
A borrowed magic drew them from the Void;<br>
They took a shape and stuff that was not theirs<br>
And showed a colour that they could not keep,<br>
Mirrors to a phantasm of reality.<br>
Each rainbow brilliance was a splendid lie;<br>
A beauty unreal graced a glamour face.<br>
Nothing could be relied on to remain:<br>

CANTO VII: The Descent into Night<br>
<br>
Joy nurtured tears and good an evil proved,<br>
But never out of evil one plucked good:<br>
Love ended early in hate, delight killed with pain,<br>
Truth into falsity grew and death ruled life.<br>
A Power that laughed at the mischiefs of the world,<br>
An irony that joined the world’s contraries<br>
And flung them into each other’s arms to strive,<br>
Put a sardonic rictus on God’s face.<br>
Aloof, its influence entered everywhere<br>
And left a cloven hoof-mark on the breast;<br>
A twisted heart and a strange sombre smile<br>
Mocked at the sinister comedy of life.<br>
Announcing the advent of a perilous Form<br>
An ominous tread softened its dire footfall<br>
That none might understand or be on guard;<br>
None heard until a dreadful grasp was close.<br>
Or else all augured a divine approach,<br>
An air of prophecy felt, a heavenly hope,<br>
Listened for a gospel, watched for a new star.<br>
The Fiend was visible but cloaked in light;<br>
He seemed a helping angel from the skies:<br>
He armed untruth with Scripture and the Law;<br>
He deceived with wisdom, with virtue slew the soul<br>
And led to perdition by the heavenward path.<br>
A lavish sense he gave of power and joy,<br>
And, when arose the warning from within,<br>
He reassured the ear with dulcet tones<br>
Or took the mind captive in its own net;<br>
His rigorous logic made the false seem true.<br>
Amazing the elect with holy lore<br>
He spoke as with the very voice of God.<br>
The air was full of treachery and ruse;<br>
Truth-speaking was a stratagem in that place;<br>
Ambush lurked in a smile and peril made<br>
Safety its cover, trust its entry’s gate:<br>
Falsehood came laughing with the eyes of truth;<br>

<br>
Each friend might turn an enemy or spy,<br>
The hand one clasped ensleeved a dagger’s stab<br>
And an embrace could be Doom’s iron cage.<br>
Agony and danger stalked their trembling prey<br>
And softly spoke as to a timid friend:<br>
Attack sprang suddenly vehement and unseen;<br>
Fear leaped upon the heart at every turn<br>
And cried out with an anguished dreadful voice;<br>
It called for one to save but none came near.<br>
All warily walked, for death was ever close;<br>
Yet caution seemed a vain expense of care,<br>
For all that guarded proved a deadly net,<br>
And when after long suspense salvation came<br>
And brought a glad relief disarming strength,<br>
It served as a smiling passage to worse fate.<br>
There was no truce and no safe place to rest;<br>
One dared not slumber or put off one’s arms:<br>
It was a world of battle and surprise.<br>
All who were there lived for themselves alone;<br>
All warred against all, but with a common hate<br>
Turned on the mind that sought some higher good;<br>
Truth was exiled lest she should dare to speak<br>
And hurt the heart of darkness with her light<br>
Or bring her pride of knowledge to blaspheme<br>
The settled anarchy of established things.<br>
Then the scene changed, but kept its dreadful core:<br>
Altering its form the life remained the same.<br>
A capital was there without a State:<br>
It had no ruler, only groups that strove.<br>
He saw a city of ancient Ignorance<br>
Founded upon a soil that knew not Light.<br>
There each in his own darkness walked alone:<br>
Only they agreed to differ in Evil’s paths,<br>
To live in their own way for their own selves<br>
Or to enforce a common lie and wrong;<br>
<br>

<br>
CANTO VII: The Descent into Night<br>
<br>
There Ego was lord upon his peacock seat<br>
And Falsehood sat by him, his mate and queen:<br>
The world turned to them as Heaven to Truth and God.<br>
Injustice justified by firm decrees<br>
The sovereign weights of Error’s legalised trade,<br>
But all the weights were false and none the same;<br>
Ever she watched with her balance and a sword,<br>
Lest any sacrilegious word expose<br>
The sanctified formulas of her old misrule.<br>
In high professions wrapped self-will walked wide<br>
And licence stalked prating of order and right:<br>
There was no altar raised to Liberty;<br>
True freedom was abhorred and hunted down:<br>
Harmony and tolerance nowhere could be seen;<br>
Each group proclaimed its dire and naked Law.<br>
A frame of ethics knobbed with scriptural rules<br>
Or a theory passionately believed and praised<br>
A table seemed of high Heaven’s sacred code.<br>
A formal practice mailed and iron-shod<br>
Gave to a rude and ruthless warrior kind<br>
Drawn from the savage bowels of the earth<br>
A proud stern poise of harsh nobility,<br>
A civic posture rigid and formidable.<br>
But all their private acts belied the pose:<br>
Power and utility were their Truth and Right,<br>
An eagle rapacity clawed its coveted good,<br>
Beaks pecked and talons tore all weaker prey.<br>
In their sweet secrecy of pleasant sins<br>
Nature they obeyed and not a moralist God.<br>
Inconscient traders in bundles of contraries,<br>
They did what in others they would persecute;<br>
When their eyes looked upon their fellow’s vice,<br>
An indignation flamed, a virtuous wrath;<br>
Oblivious of their own deep-hid offence,<br>
Moblike they stoned a neighbour caught in sin.<br>
A pragmatist judge within passed false decrees,<br>
<br>
209<br>

<br>
Posed worst iniquities on equity’s base,<br>
Reasoned ill actions just, sanctioned the scale<br>
Of the merchant ego’s interest and desire.<br>
Thus was a balance kept, the world could live.<br>
A zealot fervour pushed their ruthless cults,<br>
All faith not theirs bled scourged as heresy;<br>
They questioned, captived, tortured, burned or smote<br>
And forced the soul to abandon right or die.<br>
Amid her clashing creeds and warring sects<br>
Religion sat upon a blood-stained throne.<br>
A hundred tyrannies oppressed and slew<br>
And founded unity upon fraud and force.<br>
Only what seemed was prized as real there:<br>
The ideal was a cynic ridicule’s butt;<br>
Hooted by the crowd, mocked by enlightened wits,<br>
Spiritual seeking wandered outcasted, —<br>
A dreamer’s self-deceiving web of thought<br>
Or mad chimaera deemed or hypocrite’s fake,<br>
Its passionate instinct trailed through minds obscure<br>
Lost in the circuits of the Ignorance.<br>
A lie was there the truth and truth a lie.<br>
Here must the traveller of the upward Way —<br>
For daring Hell’s kingdoms winds the heavenly route —<br>
Pause or pass slowly through that perilous space,<br>
A prayer upon his lips and the great Name.<br>
If probed not all discernment’s keen spear-point,<br>
He might stumble into falsity’s endless net.<br>
Over his shoulder often he must look back<br>
Like one who feels on his neck an enemy’s breath;<br>
Else stealing up behind a treasonous blow<br>
Might prostrate cast and pin to unholy soil,<br>
Pierced through his back by Evil’s poignant stake.<br>
So might one fall on the Eternal’s road<br>
Forfeiting the spirit’s lonely chance in Time<br>
And no news of him reach the waiting gods,<br>
Marked “missing” in the register of souls,<br>
<br>

<br>
His name the index of a failing hope,<br>
The position of a dead remembered star.<br>
Only were safe who kept God in their hearts:<br>
Courage their armour, faith their sword, they must walk,<br>
The hand ready to smite, the eye to scout,<br>
Casting a javelin regard in front,<br>
Heroes and soldiers of the army of Light.<br>
Hardly even so, the grisly danger past,<br>
Released into a calmer purer air,<br>
They dared at length to breathe and smile once more.<br>
Once more they moved beneath a real sun.<br>
Though Hell claimed rule, the spirit still had power.<br>
This No-man’s-land he passed without debate;<br>
Him the heights missioned, him the Abyss desired:<br>
None stood across his way, no voice forbade.<br>
For swift and easy is the downward path,<br>
And now towards the Night was turned his face.<br>
A greater darkness waited, a worse reign,<br>
If worse can be where all is evil’s extreme;<br>
Yet to the cloaked the uncloaked is naked worst.<br>
There God and Truth and the supernal Light<br>
Had never been or else had power no more.<br>
As when one slips in a deep moment’s trance<br>
Over mind’s border into another world,<br>
He crossed a boundary whose stealthy trace<br>
Eye could not see but only the soul feel.<br>
Into an armoured fierce domain he came<br>
And saw himself wandering like a lost soul<br>
Amid grimed walls and savage slums of Night.<br>
Around him crowded grey and squalid huts<br>
Neighbouring proud palaces of perverted Power,<br>
Inhuman quarters and demoniac wards.<br>
A pride in evil hugged its wretchedness;<br>
A misery haunting splendour pressed those fell<br>
Dun suburbs of the cities of dream-life.<br>

<br>
There Life displayed to the spectator soul<br>
The shadow depths of her strange miracle.<br>
A strong and fallen goddess without hope,<br>
Obscured, deformed by some dire Gorgon spell,<br>
As might a harlot empress in a bouge,<br>
Nude, unashamed, exulting she upraised<br>
Her evil face of perilous beauty and charm<br>
And, drawing panic to a shuddering kiss<br>
Twixt the magnificence of her fatal breasts,<br>
Allured to their abyss the spirit’s fall.<br>
Across his field of sight she multiplied<br>
As on a scenic film or moving plate<br>
The implacable splendour of her nightmare pomps.<br>
On the dark background of a soulless world<br>
She staged between a lurid light and shade<br>
Her dramas of the sorrow of the depths<br>
Written on the agonised nerves of living things:<br>
Epics of horror and grim majesty,<br>
Wry statues spat and stiffened in life’s mud,<br>
A glut of hideous forms and hideous deeds<br>
Paralysed pity in the hardened breast.<br>
In booths of sin and night-repairs of vice<br>
Styled infamies of the body’s concupiscence<br>
And sordid imaginations etched in flesh,<br>
Turned lust into a decorative art:<br>
Abusing Nature’s gift her pervert skill<br>
Immortalised the sown grain of living death,<br>
In a mud goblet poured the bacchic wine,<br>
To a satyr gave the thyrsus of a god.<br>
Impure, sadistic, with grimacing mouths,<br>
Grey foul inventions gruesome and macabre<br>
Came televisioned from the gulfs of Night.<br>
Her craft ingenious in monstrosity,<br>
Impatient of all natural shape and poise,<br>
A gape of nude exaggerated lines,<br>
Gave caricature a stark reality,<br>
<br>
212<br>
<br>
CANTO VII: The Descent into Night<br>
<br>
And art-parades of weird distorted forms,<br>
And gargoyle masques obscene and terrible<br>
Trampled to tormented postures the torn sense.<br>
An inexorable evil’s worshipper,<br>
She made vileness great and sublimated filth;<br>
A dragon power of reptile energies<br>
And strange epiphanies of grovelling Force<br>
And serpent grandeurs couching in the mire<br>
Drew adoration to a gleam of slime.<br>
All Nature pulled out of her frame and base<br>
Was twisted into an unnatural pose:<br>
Repulsion stimulated inert desire;<br>
Agony was made a red-spiced food for bliss,<br>
Hatred was trusted with the work of lust<br>
And torture took the form of an embrace;<br>
A ritual anguish consecrated death;<br>
Worship was offered to the Undivine.<br>
A new aesthesis of Inferno’s art<br>
That trained the mind to love what the soul hates,<br>
Imposed allegiance on the quivering nerves<br>
And forced the unwilling body to vibrate.<br>
Too sweet and too harmonious to excite<br>
In this regime that soiled the being’s core,<br>
Beauty was banned, the heart’s feeling dulled to sleep<br>
And cherished in their place sensation’s thrills;<br>
The world was probed for jets of sense-appeal.<br>
Here cold material intellect was the judge<br>
And needed sensual prick and jog and lash<br>
That its hard dryness and dead nerves might feel<br>
Some passion and power and acrid point of life.<br>
A new philosophy theorised evil’s rights,<br>
Gloried in the shimmering rot of decadence,<br>
Or gave to a python Force persuasive speech<br>
And armed with knowledge the primaeval brute.<br>
Over life and Matter only brooding bowed,<br>
Mind changed to the image of a rampant beast;<br>

It scrambled into the pit to dig for truth<br>
And lighted its search with the subconscient’s flares.<br>
Thence bubbling rose sullying the upper air,<br>
The filth and festering secrets of the Abyss:<br>
This it called positive fact and real life.<br>
This now composed the fetid atmosphere.<br>
A wild-beast passion crept from secret Night<br>
To watch its prey with fascinating eyes:<br>
Around him like a fire with sputtering tongues<br>
There lolled and laughed a bestial ecstasy;<br>
The air was packed with longings brute and fierce;<br>
Crowding and stinging in a monstrous swarm<br>
Pressed with a noxious hum into his mind<br>
Thoughts that could poison Nature’s heavenliest breath,<br>
Forcing reluctant lids assailed the sight<br>
Acts that revealed the mystery of Hell.<br>
All that was there was on this pattern made.<br>
A race possessed inhabited those parts.<br>
A force demoniac lurking in man’s depths<br>
That heaves suppressed by the heart’s human law,<br>
Awed by the calm and sovereign eyes of Thought,<br>
Can in a fire and earthquake of the soul<br>
Arise and, calling to its native night,<br>
Overthrow the reason, occupy the life<br>
And stamp its hoof on Nature’s shaking ground:<br>
This was for them their being’s flaming core.<br>
A mighty energy, a monster god,<br>
Hard to the strong, implacable to the weak,<br>
It stared at the harsh unpitying world it made<br>
With the stony eyelids of its fixed idea.<br>
Its heart was drunk with a dire hunger’s wine,<br>
In others’ suffering felt a thrilled delight<br>
And of death and ruin the grandiose music heard.<br>
To have power, to be master, was sole virtue and good:<br>
It claimed the whole world for Evil’s living room,<br>

<br>
Its party’s grim totalitarian reign<br>
The cruel destiny of breathing things.<br>
All on one plan was shaped and standardised<br>
Under a dark dictatorship’s breathless weight.<br>
In street and house, in councils and in courts<br>
Beings he met who looked like living men<br>
And climbed in speech upon high wings of thought<br>
But harboured all that is subhuman, vile<br>
And lower than the lowest reptile’s crawl.<br>
The reason meant for nearness to the gods<br>
And uplift to heavenly scale by the touch of mind<br>
Only enhanced by its enlightening ray<br>
Their inborn nature’s wry monstrosity.<br>
Often, a familiar visage studying<br>
Joyfully encountered at some dangerous turn,<br>
Hoping to recognise a look of light,<br>
His vision warned by the spirit’s inward eye<br>
Discovered suddenly Hell’s trademark there,<br>
Or saw with the inner sense that cannot err,<br>
In the semblance of a fair or virile form<br>
The demon and the goblin and the ghoul.<br>
An insolence reigned of cold stone-hearted strength<br>
Mighty, obeyed, approved by the Titan’s law,<br>
The huge laughter of a giant cruelty<br>
And fierce glad deeds of ogre violence.<br>
In that wide cynic den of thinking beasts<br>
One looked in vain for a trace of pity or love;<br>
There was no touch of sweetness anywhere,<br>
But only Force and its acolytes, greed and hate:<br>
There was no help for suffering, none to save,<br>
None dared resist or speak a noble word.<br>
Armed with the aegis of tyrannic Power,<br>
Signing the edicts of her dreadful rule<br>
And using blood and torture as a seal,<br>
Darkness proclaimed her slogans to the world.<br>
A servile blinkered silence hushed the mind<br>

Or only it repeated lessons taught,<br>
While mitred, holding the good shepherd’s staff,<br>
Falsehood enthroned on awed and prostrate hearts<br>
The cults and creeds that organise living death<br>
And slay the soul on the altar of a lie.<br>
All were deceived or served their own deceit;<br>
Truth in that stifling atmosphere could not live.<br>
There wretchedness believed in its own joy<br>
And fear and weakness hugged their abject depths;<br>
All that is low and sordid-thoughted, base,<br>
All that is drab and poor and miserable,<br>
Breathed in a lax content its natural air<br>
And felt no yearning of divine release:<br>
Arrogant, gibing at more luminous states<br>
The people of the gulfs despised the sun.<br>
A barriered autarchy excluded light;<br>
Fixed in its will to be its own grey self,<br>
It vaunted its norm unique and splendid type:<br>
It soothed its hunger with a plunderer’s dream;<br>
Flaunting its cross of servitude like a crown,<br>
It clung to its dismal harsh autonomy.<br>
A bull-throat bellowed with its brazen tongue;<br>
Its hard and shameless clamour filling Space<br>
And threatening all who dared to listen to truth<br>
Claimed the monopoly of the battered ear;<br>
A deafened acquiescence gave its vote,<br>
And braggart dogmas shouted in the night<br>
Kept for the fallen soul once deemed a god<br>
The pride of its abysmal absolute.<br>
A lone discoverer in these menacing realms<br>
Guarded like termite cities from the sun,<br>
Oppressed mid crowd and tramp and noise and flare,<br>

And smote from him their clinging influences.<br>

<br>
Soon he emerged in a dim wall-less space.<br>
For now the peopled tracts were left behind;<br>
He walked between wide banks of failing eve.<br>
Around him grew a gaunt spiritual blank,<br>
A threatening waste, a sinister loneliness<br>
That left mind bare to an unseen assault,<br>
An empty page on which all that willed could write<br>
Stark monstrous messages without control.<br>
A travelling dot on downward roads of Dusk<br>
Mid barren fields and barns and straggling huts<br>
And a few crooked and phantasmal trees,<br>
He faced a sense of death and conscious void.<br>
But still a hostile Life unseen was there<br>
Whose deathlike poise resisting light and truth<br>
Made living a bleak gap in nullity.<br>
He heard the grisly voices that deny;<br>
Assailed by thoughts that swarmed like spectral hordes,<br>
A prey to the staring phantoms of the gloom<br>
And terror approaching with its lethal mouth,<br>
Driven by a strange will down ever down,<br>
The sky above a communiqué of Doom,<br>
He strove to shield his spirit from despair,<br>
But felt the horror of the growing Night<br>
And the Abyss rising to claim his soul.<br>
Then ceased the abodes of creatures and their forms<br>
And solitude wrapped him in its voiceless folds.<br>
All vanished suddenly like a thought expunged;<br>
His spirit became an empty listening gulf<br>
Void of the dead illusion of a world:<br>
Nothing was left, not even an evil face.<br>
He was alone with the grey python Night.<br>
A dense and nameless Nothing conscious, mute,<br>
Which seemed alive but without body or mind,<br>
Lusted all beings to annihilate<br>
That it might be for ever nude and sole.<br>
As in a shapeless beast’s intangible jaws,<br>

Gripped, strangled by that lusting viscous blot,<br>
Attracted to some black and giant mouth<br>
And swallowing throat and a huge belly of doom,<br>
His being from its own vision disappeared<br>
Drawn towards depths that hungered for its fall.<br>
A formless void oppressed his struggling brain,<br>
A darkness grim and cold benumbed his flesh,<br>
A whispered grey suggestion chilled his heart;<br>
Haled by a serpent-force from its warm home<br>
And dragged to extinction in bleak vacancy<br>
Life clung to its seat with cords of gasping breath;<br>
Lapped was his body by a tenebrous tongue.<br>
Existence smothered travailed to survive;<br>
Hope strangled perished in his empty soul,<br>
Belief and memory abolished died<br>
And all that helps the spirit in its course.<br>
There crawled through every tense and aching nerve<br>
Leaving behind its poignant quaking trail<br>
A nameless and unutterable fear.<br>
As a sea nears a victim bound and still,<br>
The approach alarmed his mind for ever dumb<br>
Of an implacable eternity<br>
Of pain inhuman and intolerable.<br>
This he must bear, his hope of heaven estranged;<br>
He must ever exist without extinction’s peace<br>
In a slow suffering Time and tortured Space,<br>
An anguished nothingness his endless state.<br>
A lifeless vacancy was now his breast,<br>
And in the place where once was luminous thought,<br>
Only remained like a pale motionless ghost<br>
An incapacity for faith and hope<br>
And the dread conviction of a vanquished soul<br>
Immortal still but with its godhead lost,<br>
Self lost and God and touch of happier worlds.<br>
But he endured, stilled the vain terror, bore<br>

Then peace returned and the soul’s sovereign gaze.<br>
To the blank horror a calm Light replied:<br>
Immutable, undying and unborn,<br>
Mighty and mute the Godhead in him woke<br>
And faced the pain and danger of the world.<br>
He mastered the tides of Nature with a look:<br>

In the vain braggart freedom of its thought<br>
Hoped to abolish God and reign alone.<br>

It was the gate of a false Infinite,<br>

Through a false poignant figure of grief and pain<br>
Still dolorously nailed upon a cross<br>
Fixed in the soil of a dumb insentient world<br>
Where birth was a pang and death an agony,<br>
Lest all too soon should change again to bliss.<br>

Watered with virtue the world’s upas-tree<br>
And, careful of the outward word and act,<br>
Engrafted his hypocrite blooms on native ill.<br>
All high things served their nether opposite:<br>
The forms of Gods sustained a demon cult;<br>
Heaven’s face became a mask and snare of Hell.<br>
There in the heart of vain phenomenon,<br>
In an enormous action’s writhen core<br>
He saw a Shape illimitable and vague<br>
Sitting on Death who swallows all things born.<br>
A chill fixed face with dire and motionless eyes,<br>
Her dreadful trident in her shadowy hand<br>
Outstretched, she pierced all creatures with one fate.<br>
When nothing was save Matter without soul<br>
And a spiritless hollow was the heart of Time,<br>
Then Life first touched the insensible Abyss;<br>
Awaking the stark Void to hope and grief<br>
Her pallid beam smote the unfathomed Night<br>
In which God hid himself from his own view.<br>
In all things she sought their slumbering mystic truth,<br>
The unspoken Word that inspires unconscious forms;<br>
She groped in his deeps for an invisible Law,<br>
Fumbled in the dim subconscient for his mind<br>
And strove to find a way for spirit to be.<br>
But from the Night another answer came.<br>
A seed was in that nether matrix cast,<br>
A dumb unprobed husk of perverted truth,<br>
A cell of an insentient infinite.<br>
A monstrous birth prepared its cosmic form<br>
In Nature’s titan embryo, Ignorance.<br>
Then in a fatal and stupendous hour<br>
Something that sprang from the stark Inconscient’s sleep<br>
Unwillingly begotten by the mute Void,<br>
Lifted its ominous head against the stars;<br>
Overshadowing earth with its huge body of Doom<br>
<br>
222<br>
<br>
CANTO VIII: The World of Falsehood<br>
<br>
It chilled the heavens with the menace of a face.<br>
A nameless Power, a shadowy Will arose<br>
Immense and alien to our universe.<br>
In the inconceivable Purpose none can gauge<br>
A vast Non-Being robed itself with shape,<br>
The boundless Nescience of the unconscious depths<br>
Covered eternity with nothingness.<br>
A seeking Mind replaced the seeing Soul:<br>
Life grew into a huge and hungry death,<br>
The Spirit’s bliss was changed to cosmic pain.<br>
Assuring God’s self-cowled neutrality<br>
A mighty opposition conquered Space.<br>
A sovereign ruling falsehood, death and grief,<br>
It pressed its fierce hegemony on the earth;<br>
Disharmonising the original style<br>
Of the architecture of her fate’s design,<br>
It falsified the primal cosmic Will<br>
And bound to struggle and dread vicissitudes<br>
The long slow process of the patient Power.<br>
Implanting error in the stuff of things<br>
It made an Ignorance of the all-wise Law;<br>
It baffled the sure touch of life’s hid sense,<br>
Kept dumb the intuitive guide in Matter’s sleep,<br>
Deformed the insect’s instinct and the brute’s,<br>
Disfigured man’s thought-born humanity.<br>
A shadow fell across the simple Ray:<br>
Obscured was the Truth-light in the cavern heart<br>
That burns unwitnessed in the altar crypt<br>
Behind the still velamen’s secrecy<br>
Companioning the Godhead of the shrine.<br>
Thus was the dire antagonist Energy born<br>
Who mimes the eternal Mother’s mighty shape<br>
And mocks her luminous infinity<br>
With a grey distorted silhouette in the Night.<br>
Arresting the passion of the climbing soul,<br>
She forced on life a slow and faltering pace;<br>
<br>
223<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Her hand’s deflecting and retarding weight<br>
Is laid on the mystic evolution’s curve:<br>
The tortuous line of her deceiving mind<br>
The Gods see not and man is impotent;<br>
Oppressing the God-spark within the soul<br>
She forces back to the beast the human fall.<br>
Yet in her formidable instinctive mind<br>
She feels the One grow in the heart of Time<br>
And sees the Immortal shine through the human mould.<br>
Alarmed for her rule and full of fear and rage<br>
She prowls around each light that gleams through the dark<br>
Casting its ray from the spirit’s lonely tent,<br>
Hoping to enter with fierce stealthy tread<br>
And in the cradle slay the divine Child.<br>
Incalculable are her strength and ruse;<br>
Her touch is a fascination and a death;<br>
She kills her victim with his own delight;<br>
Even Good she makes a hook to drag to Hell.<br>
For her the world runs to its agony.<br>
Often the pilgrim on the Eternal’s road<br>
Ill-lit from clouds by the pale moon of Mind,<br>
Or in devious byways wandering alone,<br>
Or lost in deserts where no path is seen,<br>
Falls overpowered by her lion leap,<br>
A conquered captive under her dreadful paws.<br>
Intoxicated by a burning breath<br>
And amorous grown of a destroying mouth,<br>
Once a companion of the sacred Fire,<br>
The mortal perishes to God and Light,<br>
An Adversary governs heart and brain,<br>
A Nature hostile to the Mother-Force.<br>
The self of life yields up its instruments<br>
To Titan and demoniac agencies<br>
That aggrandise earth-nature and disframe:<br>
A cowled fifth-columnist is now thought’s guide;<br>
His subtle defeatist murmur slays the faith<br>
<br>
224<br>
<br>
CANTO VIII: The World of Falsehood<br>
<br>
And, lodged in the breast or whispering from outside,<br>
A lying inspiration fell and dark<br>
A new order substitutes for the divine.<br>
A silence falls upon the spirit’s heights,<br>
From the veiled sanctuary the God retires,<br>
Empty and cold is the chamber of the Bride;<br>
The golden Nimbus now is seen no more,<br>
No longer burns the white spiritual ray<br>
And hushed for ever is the secret Voice.<br>
Then by the Angel of the Vigil Tower<br>
A name is struck from the recording book;<br>
A flame that sang in Heaven sinks quenched and mute;<br>
In ruin ends the epic of a soul.<br>
This is the tragedy of the inner death<br>
When forfeited is the divine element<br>
And only a mind and body live to die.<br>
For terrible agencies the Spirit allows<br>
And there are subtle and enormous Powers<br>
That shield themselves with the covering Ignorance.<br>
Offspring of the gulfs, agents of the shadowy Force,<br>
Haters of light, intolerant of peace,<br>
Aping to the thought the shining Friend and Guide,<br>
Opposing in the heart the eternal Will,<br>
They veil the occult uplifting Harmonist.<br>
His wisdom’s oracles are made our bonds;<br>
The doors of God they have locked with keys of creed<br>
And shut out by the Law his tireless Grace.<br>
Along all Nature’s lines they have set their posts<br>
And intercept the caravans of Light;<br>
Wherever the Gods act, they intervene.<br>
A yoke is laid upon the world’s dim heart;<br>
Masked are its beats from the supernal Bliss,<br>
And the closed peripheries of brilliant Mind<br>
Block the fine entries of celestial Fire.<br>
Always the dark Adventurers seem to win;<br>

Nature they fill with evil’s institutes,<br>
Turn into defeats the victories of Truth,<br>
Proclaim as falsehoods the eternal laws,<br>
And load the dice of Doom with wizard lies;<br>
The world’s shrines they have occupied, usurped its thrones.<br>
In scorn of the dwindling chances of the Gods<br>
They claim creation as their conquered fief<br>
And crown themselves the iron Lords of Time.<br>
Adepts of the illusion and the mask,<br>
The artificers of Nature’s fall and pain<br>
Have built their altars of triumphant Night<br>
In the clay temple of terrestrial life.<br>
In the vacant precincts of the sacred Fire,<br>
In front of the reredos in the mystic rite<br>
Facing the dim velamen none can pierce,<br>
Intones his solemn hymn the mitred priest<br>
Invoking their dreadful presence in his breast:<br>
Attributing to them the awful Name<br>
He chants the syllables of the magic text<br>
And summons the unseen communion’s act,<br>
While twixt the incense and the muttered prayer<br>
All the fierce bale with which the world is racked<br>
Is mixed in the foaming chalice of man’s heart<br>
And poured to them like sacramental wine.<br>
Assuming names divine they guide and rule.<br>
Opponents of the Highest they have come<br>
Out of their world of soulless thought and power<br>
To serve by enmity the cosmic scheme.<br>
Night is their refuge and strategic base.<br>
Against the sword of Flame, the luminous Eye,<br>
Bastioned they live in massive forts of gloom,<br>
Calm and secure in sunless privacy:<br>
No wandering ray of Heaven can enter there.<br>
Armoured, protected by their lethal masks,<br>
As in a studio of creative Death<br>
The giant sons of Darkness sit and plan<br>
<br>
CANTO VIII: The World of Falsehood<br>
<br>
The drama of the earth, their tragic stage.<br>
All who would raise the fallen world must come<br>
Under the dangerous arches of their power;<br>
For even the radiant children of the gods<br>
To darken their privilege is and dreadful right.<br>
None can reach heaven who has not passed through hell.<br>
This too the traveller of the worlds must dare.<br>
A warrior in the dateless duel’s strife,<br>
He entered into dumb despairing Night<br>
Challenging the darkness with his luminous soul.<br>
Alarming with his steps the threshold gloom<br>
He came into a fierce and dolorous realm<br>
Peopled by souls who never had tasted bliss;<br>
Ignorant like men born blind who know not light,<br>
They could equate worst ill with highest good,<br>
Virtue was to their eyes a face of sin<br>
And evil and misery were their natural state.<br>
A dire administration’s penal code<br>
Making of grief and pain the common law,<br>
Decreeing universal joylessness<br>
Had changed life into a stoic sacrament<br>
And torture into a daily festival.<br>
An act was passed to chastise happiness;<br>
Laughter and pleasure were banned as deadly sins:<br>
A questionless mind was ranked as wise content,<br>
A dull heart’s silent apathy as peace:<br>
Sleep was not there, torpor was the sole rest,<br>
Death came but neither respite gave nor end;<br>
Always the soul lived on and suffered more.<br>
Ever he deeper probed that kingdom of pain;<br>
Around him grew the terror of a world<br>
Of agony followed by worse agony,<br>
And in the terror a great wicked joy<br>
Glad of one’s own and others’ calamity.<br>
There thought and life were a long punishment,<br>
<br>
227<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
The breath a burden and all hope a scourge,<br>
The body a field of torment, a massed unease;<br>
Repose was a waiting between pang and pang.<br>
This was the law of things none dreamed to change:<br>
A hard sombre heart, a harsh unsmiling mind<br>
Rejected happiness like a cloying sweet;<br>
Tranquillity was a tedium and ennui:<br>
Only by suffering life grew colourful;<br>
It needed the spice of pain, the salt of tears.<br>
If one could cease to be, all would be well;<br>
Else only fierce sensations gave some zest:<br>
A fury of jealousy burning the gnawed heart,<br>
The sting of murderous spite and hate and lust,<br>
The whisper that lures to the pit and treachery’s stroke<br>
Threw vivid spots on the dull aching hours.<br>
To watch the drama of infelicity,<br>
The writhing of creatures under the harrow of doom<br>
And sorrow’s tragic gaze into the night<br>
And horror and the hammering heart of fear<br>
Were the ingredients in Time’s heavy cup<br>
That pleased and helped to enjoy its bitter taste.<br>
Of such fierce stuff was made up life’s long hell:<br>
These were the threads of the dark spider’s-web<br>
In which the soul was caught, quivering and rapt;<br>
This was religion, this was Nature’s rule.<br>
In a fell chapel of iniquity<br>
To worship a black pitiless image of Power<br>
Kneeling one must cross hard-hearted stony courts,<br>
A pavement like a floor of evil fate.<br>
Each stone was a keen edge of ruthless force<br>
And glued with the chilled blood from tortured breasts;<br>
The dry gnarled trees stood up like dying men<br>
Stiffened into a pose of agony,<br>
And from each window peered an ominous priest<br>
Chanting Te Deums for slaughter’s crowning grace,<br>
Uprooted cities, blasted human homes,<br>
Burned writhen bodies, the bombshell’s massacre.<br>
<br>
228<br>

CANTO VIII: The World of Falsehood<br>
<br>
“Our enemies are fallen, are fallen,” they sang,<br>
“All who once stayed our will are smitten and dead;<br>
How great we are, how merciful art Thou.”<br>
Thus thought they to reach God’s impassive throne<br>
And Him command whom all their acts opposed,<br>
Magnifying their deeds to touch his skies,<br>
And make him an accomplice of their crimes.<br>
There no relenting pity could have place,<br>
But ruthless strength and iron moods had sway,<br>
A dateless sovereignty of terror and gloom:<br>
This took the figure of a darkened God<br>
Revered by the racked wretchedness he had made,<br>
Who held in thrall a miserable world,<br>
And helpless hearts nailed to unceasing woe<br>
Adored the feet that trampled them into mire.<br>
It was a world of sorrow and of hate,<br>
Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy,<br>
Hatred with others’ sorrow as its feast;<br>
A bitter rictus curled the suffering mouth;<br>
A tragic cruelty saw its ominous chance.<br>
Hate was the black archangel of that realm;<br>
It glowed, a sombre jewel in the heart<br>
Burning the soul with its malignant rays,<br>
And wallowed in its fell abysm of might.<br>
These passions even objects seemed to exude, —<br>
For mind overflowed into the inanimate<br>
That answered with the wickedness it received, —<br>
Against their users used malignant powers,<br>
Hurt without hands and strangely, suddenly slew,<br>
Appointed as instruments of an unseen doom.<br>
Or they made themselves a fateful prison wall<br>
Where men condemned wake through the creeping hours<br>
Counted by the tollings of an ominous bell.<br>
An evil environment worsened evil souls:<br>
All things were conscious there and all perverse.<br>
In this infernal realm he dared to press<br>
Even into its deepest pit and darkest core,<br>
<br>
229<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Perturbed its tenebrous base, dared to contest<br>
Its ancient privileged right and absolute force:<br>
In Night he plunged to know her dreadful heart,<br>
In Hell he sought the root and cause of Hell.<br>
Its anguished gulfs opened in his own breast;<br>
He listened to clamours of its crowded pain,<br>
The heart-beats of its fatal loneliness.<br>
Above was a chill deaf eternity.<br>
In vague tremendous passages of Doom<br>
He heard the goblin Voice that guides to slay,<br>
And faced the enchantments of the demon Sign,<br>
And traversed the ambush of the opponent Snake.<br>
In menacing tracts, in tortured solitudes<br>
Companionless he roamed through desolate ways<br>
Where the red Wolf waits by the fordless stream<br>
And Death’s black eagles scream to the precipice,<br>
And met the hounds of bale who hunt men’s hearts<br>
Baying across the veldts of Destiny,<br>
In footless battlefields of the Abyss<br>
Fought shadowy combats in mute eyeless depths,<br>
Assaults of Hell endured and Titan strokes<br>
And bore the fierce inner wounds that are slow to heal.<br>
A prisoner of a hooded magic Force,<br>
Captured and trailed in Falsehood’s lethal net<br>
And often strangled in the noose of grief,<br>
Or cast in the grim morass of swallowing doubt,<br>
Or shut into pits of error and despair,<br>
He drank her poison draughts till none was left.<br>
In a world where neither hope nor joy could come<br>
The ordeal he suffered of evil’s absolute reign,<br>
Yet kept intact his spirit’s radiant truth.<br>
Incapable of motion or of force,<br>
In Matter’s blank denial gaoled and blind,<br>
Pinned to the black inertia of our base<br>
He treasured between his hands his flickering soul.<br>
His being ventured into mindless Void,<br>
Intolerant gulfs that knew not thought nor sense;<br>
<br>
230<br>
<br>
CANTO VIII: The World of Falsehood<br>
<br>
Thought ceased, sense failed, his soul still saw and knew.<br>
In atomic parcellings of the Infinite<br>
Near to the dumb beginnings of lost Self,<br>
He felt the curious small futility<br>
Of the creation of material things.<br>
Or, stifled in the Inconscient’s hollow dusk,<br>
He sounded the mystery dark and bottomless<br>
Of the enormous and unmeaning deeps<br>
Whence struggling life in a dead universe rose.<br>
There in the stark identity lost by mind<br>
He felt the sealed sense of the insensible world<br>
And a mute wisdom in the unknowing Night.<br>
Into the abysmal secrecy he came<br>
Where darkness peers from her mattress, grey and nude,<br>
And stood on the last locked subconscient’s floor<br>
Where Being slept unconscious of its thoughts<br>
And built the world not knowing what it built.<br>
There waiting its hour the future lay unknown,<br>
There is the record of the vanished stars.<br>
There in the slumber of the cosmic Will<br>
He saw the secret key of Nature’s change.<br>
A light was with him, an invisible hand<br>
Was laid upon the error and the pain<br>
Till it became a quivering ecstasy,<br>
The shock of sweetness of an arm’s embrace.<br>
He saw in Night the Eternal’s shadowy veil,<br>
Knew death for a cellar of the house of life,<br>
In destruction felt creation’s hasty pace,<br>
Knew loss as the price of a celestial gain<br>
And hell as a short cut to heaven’s gates.<br>
Then in Illusion’s occult factory<br>
And in the Inconscient’s magic printing-house<br>
Torn were the formats of the primal Night<br>
And shattered the stereotypes of Ignorance.<br>
Alive, breathing a deep spiritual breath,<br>
Nature expunged her stiff mechanical code<br>
And the articles of the bound soul’s contract,<br>
<br>

Falsehood gave back to Truth her tortured shape.<br>
Annulled were the tables of the law of Pain,<br>
And in their place grew luminous characters.<br>
The skilful Penman’s unseen finger wrote<br>
His swift intuitive calligraphy;<br>
Earth’s forms were made his divine documents,<br>
The wisdom embodied mind could not reveal,<br>
Inconscience chased from the world’s voiceless breast;<br>
Transfigured were the fixed schemes of reasoning Thought.<br>
Arousing consciousness in things inert,<br>
He imposed upon dark atom and dumb mass<br>
The diamond script of the Imperishable,<br>
Inscribed on the dim heart of fallen things<br>
A paean-song of the free Infinite<br>
And the Name, foundation of eternity,<br>
And traced on the awake exultant cells<br>
In the ideographs of the Ineffable<br>
The lyric of the love that waits through Time<br>
And the mystic volume of the Book of Bliss<br>
And the message of the superconscient Fire.<br>
Then life beat pure in the corporeal frame;<br>
The infernal Gleam died and could slay no more.<br>
Hell split across its huge abrupt façade<br>
As if a magic building were undone,<br>
Night opened and vanished like a gulf of dream.<br>
Into being’s gap scooped out as empty Space<br>
In which she had filled the place of absent God,<br>
There poured a wide intimate and blissful Dawn;<br>
Healed were all things that Time’s torn heart had made<br>
And sorrow could live no more in Nature’s breast:<br>
Division ceased to be, for God was there.<br>
The soul lit the conscious body with its ray,<br>
Matter and spirit mingled and were one.<br>

A lustre of some rapturous Infinite,<br>
It held in the splendour of its golden laugh<br>
Regions of the heart’s happiness set free,<br>
Intoxicated with the wine of God,<br>
Immersed in light, perpetually divine.<br>
A favourite and intimate of the Gods<br>
Obeying the divine command to joy,<br>
It was the sovereign of its own delight<br>
And master of the kingdoms of its force.<br>
Assured of the bliss for which all forms were made,<br>
Unmoved by fear and grief and the shocks of Fate<br>
And unalarmed by the breath of fleeting Time<br>
And unbesieged by adverse circumstance,<br>
It breathed in a sweet secure unguarded ease<br>
Free from our body’s frailty inviting death,<br>
Far from our danger-zone of stumbling Will.<br>
It needed not to curb its passionate beats;<br>
Thrilled by the clasp of the warm satisfied sense<br>
And the swift wonder-rush and flame and cry<br>
Of the life-impulses’ red magnificent race,<br>
It lived in a jewel-rhythm of the laughter of God<br>
And lay on the breast of universal love.<br>
Immune the unfettered Spirit of Delight<br>
Pastured his gleaming sun-herds and moon-flocks<br>
Along the lyric speed of griefless streams<br>
In fragrance of the unearthly asphodel.<br>

A murmur of inarticulate ravishment<br>
Trembled in the winds and touched the enchanted soil;<br>

Incessant in the arms of ecstasy<br>
Repeating its sweet involuntary note<br>
A sob of rapture flowed along the hours.<br>
Advancing under an arch of glory and peace,<br>
Traveller on plateau and on musing ridge,<br>
As one who sees in the World-Magician’s glass<br>
A miracled imagery of soul-scapes flee<br>
He traversed scenes of an immortal joy<br>
And gazed into abysms of beauty and bliss.<br>
Around him was a light of conscious suns<br>
And a brooding gladness of great symbol things;<br>
To meet him crowded plains of brilliant calm,<br>
Mountains and violet valleys of the Blest,<br>
Deep glens of joy and crooning waterfalls<br>
And woods of quivering purple solitude;<br>
Below him lay like gleaming jewelled thoughts<br>
Rapt dreaming cities of Gandharva kings.<br>
Across the vibrant secrecies of Space<br>
A dim and happy music sweetly stole,<br>
Smitten by unseen hands he heard heart-close<br>
The harps’ cry of the heavenly minstrels pass,<br>
And voices of unearthly melody<br>
Chanted the glory of eternal love<br>
In the white-blue-moonbeam air of Paradise.<br>
A summit and core of all that marvellous world,<br>
Apart stood high Elysian nameless hills,<br>
Burning like sunsets in a trance of eve.<br>
As if to some new unsearched profundity,<br>
Into a joyful stillness plunged their base;<br>
Their slopes through a hurry of laughter and voices sank,<br>
Crossed by a throng of singing rivulets,<br>
Adoring blue heaven with their happy hymn,<br>
Down into woods of shadowy secrecy:<br>
Lifted into wide voiceless mystery<br>
Their peaks climbed towards a greatness beyond life.<br>

All things were perfect there that flower in Time;<br>
Beauty was there creation’s native mould,<br>
Peace was a thrilled voluptuous purity.<br>
There Love fulfilled her gold and roseate dreams<br>
And Strength her crowned and mighty reveries;<br>
Desire climbed up, a swift omnipotent flame,<br>
And Pleasure had the stature of the gods;<br>
Dream walked along the highways of the stars;<br>
Sweet common things turned into miracles:<br>
Overtaken by the spirit’s sudden spell,<br>
Smitten by a divine passion’s alchemy,<br>
Pain’s self compelled transformed to potent joy<br>
Curing the antithesis twixt heaven and hell.<br>
All life’s high visions are embodied there,<br>
Her wandering hopes achieved, her aureate combs<br>
Caught by the honey-eater’s darting tongue,<br>
Her burning guesses changed to ecstasied truths,<br>
Her mighty pantings stilled in deathless calm<br>
And liberated her immense desires.<br>
In that paradise of perfect heart and sense<br>
No lower note could break the endless charm<br>
Of her sweetness ardent and immaculate;<br>
Her steps are sure of their intuitive fall.<br>
After the anguish of the soul’s long strife<br>
At length were found calm and celestial rest<br>
And, lapped in a magic flood of sorrowless hours,<br>
Healed were his warrior nature’s wounded limbs<br>
In the encircling arms of Energies<br>
That brooked no stain and feared not their own bliss.<br>
In scenes forbidden to our pallid sense<br>
Amid miraculous scents and wonder-hues<br>
He met the forms that divinise the sight,<br>
To music that can immortalise the mind<br>
And make the heart wide as infinity<br>
Listened, and captured the inaudible<br>

Cadences that awake the occult ear:<br>
Out of the ineffable hush it hears them come<br>
Trembling with the beauty of a wordless speech,<br>
And thoughts too great and deep to find a voice,<br>
Thoughts whose desire new-makes the universe.<br>
A scale of sense that climbed with fiery feet<br>
To heights of unimagined happiness,<br>
Recast his being’s aura in joy-glow,<br>
His body glimmered like a skiey shell;<br>
His gates to the world were swept with seas of light.<br>
His earth, dowered with celestial competence,<br>
Harboured a power that needed now no more<br>
To cross the closed customs-line of mind and flesh<br>
And smuggle godhead into humanity.<br>
It shrank no more from the supreme demand<br>
Of an untired capacity for bliss,<br>
A might that could explore its own infinite<br>
And beauty and passion and the depths’ reply<br>
Nor feared the swoon of glad identity<br>
Where spirit and flesh in inner ecstasy join<br>
Annulling the quarrel between self and shape.<br>
It drew from sight and sound spiritual power,<br>
Made sense a road to reach the intangible:<br>
It thrilled with the supernal influences<br>
That build the substance of life’s deeper soul.<br>
Earth-nature stood reborn, comrade of heaven.<br>
A fit companion of the timeless Kings,<br>
Equalled with the godheads of the living Suns,<br>
He mixed in the radiant pastimes of the Unborn,<br>
Heard whispers of the Player never seen<br>
And listened to his voice that steals the heart<br>
And draws it to the breast of God’s desire,<br>
And felt its honey of felicity<br>
Flow through his veins like the rivers of Paradise,<br>
Made body a nectar-cup of the Absolute.<br>

In passionate responses half-unveiled<br>
He reached the rim of ecstasies unknown;<br>
A touch supreme surprised his hurrying heart,<br>
The clasp was remembered of the Wonderful,<br>
And hints leaped down of white beatitudes.<br>
Eternity drew close disguised as Love<br>
And laid its hand upon the body of Time.<br>
A little gift comes from the Immensitudes,<br>
But measureless to life its gain of joy;<br>
All the untold Beyond is mirrored there.<br>
A giant drop of the Bliss unknowable<br>
Overwhelmed his limbs and round his soul became<br>
A fiery ocean of felicity;<br>
He foundered drowned in sweet and burning vasts:<br>
The dire delight that could shatter mortal flesh,<br>
The rapture that the gods sustain he bore.<br>
Immortal pleasure cleansed him in its waves<br>
And turned his strength into undying power.<br>
Immortality captured Time and carried Life.<br>

A memory soft as grass and faint as sleep,<br>
The beauty and call receding sank behind<br>
Like a sweet song heard fading far away<br>
Upon the long high road to Timelessness.<br>
Above was an ardent white tranquillity.<br>
A musing spirit looked out on the worlds<br>
And like a brilliant clambering of skies<br>
Passing through clarity to an unseen Light<br>
Large lucent realms of Mind from stillness shone.<br>
But first he met a silver-grey expanse<br>
Where Day and Night had wedded and were one:<br>
It was a tract of dim and shifting rays<br>
Parting Life’s sentient flow from Thought’s self-poise.<br>
A coalition of uncertainties<br>
There exercised uneasy government<br>
On a ground reserved for doubt and reasoned guess,<br>
A rendezvous of Knowledge with Ignorance.<br>
At its low extremity held difficult sway<br>
A mind that hardly saw and slowly found;<br>
Its nature to our earthly nature close<br>
And kin to our precarious mortal thought<br>
That looks from soil to sky and sky to soil<br>
But knows not the below nor the beyond,<br>
It only sensed itself and outward things.<br>
This was the first means of our slow ascent<br>
From the half-conscience of the animal soul<br>
Living in a crowded press of shape-events<br>
In a realm it cannot understand nor change;<br>
Only it sees and acts in a given scene<br>
And feels and joys and sorrows for a while.<br>
The ideas that drive the obscure embodied spirit<br>
Along the roads of suffering and desire<br>
In a world that struggles to discover Truth,<br>
Found here their power to be and Nature-force.<br>
Here are devised the forms of an ignorant life<br>
<br>

<br>
That sees the empiric fact as settled law,<br>
Labours for the hour and not for eternity<br>
And trades its gains to meet the moment’s call:<br>
The slow process of a material mind<br>
Which serves the body it should rule and use<br>
And needs to lean upon an erring sense,<br>
Was born in that luminous obscurity.<br>
Advancing tardily from a limping start,<br>
Crutching hypothesis on argument,<br>
Throning its theories as certitudes,<br>
It reasons from the half-known to the unknown,<br>
Ever constructing its frail house of thought,<br>
Ever undoing the web that it has spun.<br>
A twilight sage whose shadow seems to him self,<br>
Moving from minute to brief minute lives;<br>
A king dependent on his satellites<br>
Signs the decrees of ignorant ministers,<br>
A judge in half-possession of his proofs,<br>
A voice clamant of uncertainty’s postulates,<br>
An architect of knowledge, not its source.<br>
This powerful bondslave of his instruments<br>
Thinks his low station Nature’s highest top,<br>
Oblivious of his share in all things made<br>
And haughtily humble in his own conceit<br>
Believes himself a spawn of Matter’s mud<br>
And takes his own creations for his cause.<br>
To eternal light and knowledge meant to rise,<br>
Up from man’s bare beginning is our climb;<br>
Out of earth’s heavy smallness we must break,<br>
We must search our nature with spiritual fire:<br>
An insect crawl preludes our glorious flight;<br>
Our human state cradles the future god,<br>
Our mortal frailty an immortal force.<br>
At the glow-worm top of these pale glimmer-realms<br>
Where dawn-sheen gambolled with the native dusk<br>
And helped the Day to grow and Night to fail,<br>
<br>

<br>
Escaping over a wide and shimmering bridge,<br>
He came into a realm of early Light<br>
And the regency of a half-risen sun.<br>
Out of its rays our mind’s full orb was born.<br>
Appointed by the Spirit of the Worlds<br>
To mediate with the unknowing depths,<br>
A prototypal deft Intelligence<br>
Half-poised on equal wings of thought and doubt<br>
Toiled ceaselessly twixt being’s hidden ends.<br>
A Secrecy breathed in life’s moving act;<br>
A covert nurse of Nature’s miracles,<br>
It shaped life’s wonders out of Matter’s mud:<br>
It cut the pattern of the shapes of things,<br>
It pitched mind’s tent in the vague ignorant Vast.<br>
A master Magician of measure and device<br>
Has made an eternity from recurring forms<br>
And to the wandering spectator thought<br>
Assigned a seat on the inconscient stage.<br>
On earth by the will of this Arch-Intelligence<br>
A bodiless energy put on Matter’s robe;<br>
Proton and photon served the imager Eye<br>
To change things subtle into a physical world<br>
And the invisible appeared as shape<br>
And the impalpable was felt as mass:<br>
Magic of percept joined with concept’s art<br>
And lent to each object an interpreting name:<br>
Idea was disguised in a body’s artistry,<br>
And by a strange atomic law’s mystique<br>
A frame was made in which the sense could put<br>
Its symbol picture of the universe.<br>
Even a greater miracle was done.<br>
The mediating light linked body’s power,<br>
The sleep and dreaming of the tree and plant,<br>
The animal’s vibrant sense, the thought in man,<br>
To the effulgence of a Ray above.<br>
Its skill endorsing Matter’s right to think<br>
<br>

Cut sentient passages for the mind of flesh<br>
And found a means for Nescience to know.<br>
Offering its little squares and cubes of word<br>
As figured substitutes for reality,<br>
A mummified mnemonic alphabet,<br>
It helped the unseeing Force to read her works.<br>
A buried consciousness arose in her<br>
And now she dreams herself human and awake.<br>
But all was still a mobile Ignorance;<br>
Still Knowledge could not come and firmly grasp<br>
This huge invention seen as a universe.<br>
A specialist of logic’s hard machine<br>
Imposed its rigid artifice on the soul;<br>
An aide of the inventor intellect,<br>
It cut Truth into manageable bits<br>
That each might have his ration of thought-food,<br>
Then new-built Truth’s slain body by its art:<br>
A robot exact and serviceable and false<br>
Displaced the spirit’s finer view of things:<br>
A polished engine did the work of a god.<br>
None the true body found, its soul seemed dead:<br>
None had the inner look which sees Truth’s whole;<br>
All glorified the glittering substitute.<br>
Then from the secret heights a wave swept down,<br>
A brilliant chaos of rebel light arose;<br>
It looked above and saw the dazzling peaks,<br>
It looked within and woke the sleeping god.<br>
Imagination called her shining squads<br>
That venture into undiscovered scenes<br>
Where all the marvels lurk none yet has known:<br>
Lifting her beautiful and miraculous head,<br>
She conspired with inspiration’s sister brood<br>
To fill thought’s skies with glimmering nebulae.<br>
A bright Error fringed the mystery-altar’s frieze;<br>
Darkness grew nurse to wisdom’s occult sun,<br>
Myth suckled knowledge with her lustrous milk;<br>

<br>
The infant passed from dim to radiant breasts.<br>
Thus worked the Power upon the growing world;<br>
Its subtle craft withheld the full-orbed blaze,<br>
Cherished the soul’s childhood and on fictions fed<br>
Far richer in their sweet and nectarous sap<br>
Nourishing its immature divinity<br>
Than the staple or dry straw of Reason’s tilth,<br>
Its heaped fodder of innumerable facts,<br>
Plebeian fare on which today we thrive.<br>
Thus streamed down from the realm of early Light<br>
Ethereal thinkings into Matter’s world;<br>
Its gold-horned herds trooped into earth’s cave-heart.<br>
Its morning rays illume our twilight’s eyes,<br>
Its young formations move the mind of earth<br>
To labour and to dream and new-create,<br>
To feel beauty’s touch and know the world and self:<br>
The Golden Child began to think and see.<br>
In those bright realms are Mind’s first forward steps.<br>
Ignorant of all but eager to know all,<br>
Its curious slow enquiry there begins;<br>
Ever its searching grasps at shapes around,<br>
Ever it hopes to find out greater things.<br>
Ardent and golden-gleamed with sunrise fires,<br>
Alert it lives upon invention’s verge.<br>
Yet all it does is on an infant’s scale,<br>
As if the cosmos were a nursery game,<br>
Mind, life the playthings of a Titan’s babe.<br>
As one it works who builds a mimic fort<br>
Miraculously stable for a while,<br>
Made of the sands upon a bank of Time<br>
Mid an occult eternity’s shoreless sea.<br>
A small keen instrument the great Puissance chose,<br>
An arduous pastime passionately pursues;<br>
To teach the Ignorance is her difficult charge,<br>
Her thought starts from an original nescient Void<br>
<br>
243<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
And what she teaches she herself must learn<br>
Arousing knowledge from its sleepy lair.<br>
For knowledge comes not to us as a guest<br>
Called into our chamber from the outer world;<br>
A friend and inmate of our secret self,<br>
It hid behind our minds and fell asleep<br>
And slowly wakes beneath the blows of life;<br>
The mighty daemon lies unshaped within,<br>
To evoke, to give it form is Nature’s task.<br>
All was a chaos of the true and false,<br>
Mind sought amid deep mists of Nescience;<br>
It looked within itself but saw not God.<br>
A material interim diplomacy<br>
Denied the Truth that transient truths might live<br>
And hid the Deity in creed and guess<br>
That the World-Ignorance might grow slowly wise.<br>
This was the imbroglio made by sovereign Mind<br>
Looking from a gleam-ridge into the Night<br>
In her first tamperings with Inconscience:<br>
Its alien dusk baffles her luminous eyes;<br>
Her rapid hands must learn a cautious zeal;<br>
Only a slow advance the earth can bear.<br>
Yet was her strength unlike the unseeing earth’s<br>
Compelled to handle makeshift instruments<br>
Invented by the life-force and the flesh.<br>
Earth all perceives through doubtful images,<br>
All she conceives in hazardous jets of sight,<br>
Small lights kindled by touches of groping thought.<br>
Incapable of the soul’s direct inlook<br>
She sees by spasms and solders knowledge-scrap,<br>
Makes Truth the slave-girl of her indigence,<br>
Expelling Nature’s mystic unity<br>
Cuts into quantum and mass the moving All;<br>
She takes for measuring-rod her ignorance.<br>
In her own domain a pontiff and a seer,<br>
That greater Power with her half-risen sun<br>
<br>
244<br>
<br>
CANTO X: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Little Mind<br>
<br>
Wrought within limits but possessed her field;<br>
She knew by a privilege of thinking force<br>
And claimed an infant sovereignty of sight.<br>
In her eyes however darkly fringed was lit<br>
The Archangel’s gaze who knows inspired his acts<br>
And shapes a world in its far-seeing flame.<br>
In her own realm she stumbles not nor fails,<br>
But moves in boundaries of subtle power<br>
Across which mind can step towards the sun.<br>
A candidate for a higher suzerainty,<br>
A passage she cut through from Night to Light,<br>
And searched for an ungrasped Omniscience.<br>
A dwarf three-bodied trinity was her serf.<br>
First, smallest of the three, but strong of limb,<br>
A low-brow with a square and heavy jowl,<br>
A pigmy Thought needing to live in bounds<br>
For ever stooped to hammer fact and form.<br>
Absorbed and cabined in external sight,<br>
It takes its stand on Nature’s solid base.<br>
A technician admirable, a thinker crude,<br>
A riveter of Life to habit’s grooves,<br>
Obedient to gross Matter’s tyranny,<br>
A prisoner of the moulds in which it works,<br>
It binds itself by what itself creates.<br>
A slave of a fixed mass of absolute rules,<br>
It sees as Law the habits of the world,<br>
It sees as Truth the habits of the mind.<br>
In its realm of concrete images and events<br>
Turning in a worn circle of ideas<br>
And ever repeating old familiar acts,<br>
It lives content with the common and the known.<br>
It loves the old ground that was its dwelling-place:<br>
Abhorring change as an audacious sin,<br>
Distrustful of each new discovery<br>
Only it advances step by careful step<br>
<br>
245<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
And fears as if a deadly abyss the unknown.<br>
A prudent treasurer of its ignorance,<br>
It shrinks from adventure, blinks at glorious hope,<br>
Preferring a safe foothold upon things<br>
To the dangerous joy of wideness and of height.<br>
The world’s slow impressions on its labouring mind,<br>
Tardy imprints almost indelible,<br>
Increase their value by their poverty;<br>
The old sure memories are its capital stock:<br>
Only what sense can grasp seems absolute:<br>
External fact it figures as sole truth,<br>
Wisdom identifies with the earthward look,<br>
And things long known and actions always done<br>
Are to its clinging hold a balustrade<br>
Of safety on the perilous stair of Time.<br>
Heaven’s trust to it are the established ancient ways,<br>
Immutable laws man has no right to change,<br>
A sacred legacy from the great dead past<br>
Or the one road that God has made for life,<br>
A firm shape of Nature never to be changed,<br>
Part of the huge routine of the universe.<br>
A smile from the Preserver of the Worlds<br>
Sent down of old this guardian Mind to earth<br>
That all might stand in their fixed changeless type<br>
And from their secular posture never move.<br>
One sees it circling faithful to its task,<br>
Tireless in an assigned tradition’s round;<br>
In decayed and crumbling offices of Time<br>
It keeps close guard in front of custom’s wall,<br>
Or in an ancient Night’s dim environs<br>
It dozes on a little courtyard’s stones<br>
And barks at every unfamiliar light<br>
As at a foe who would break up its home,<br>
A watch-dog of the spirit’s sense-railed house<br>
Against intruders from the Invisible,<br>
Nourished on scraps of life and Matter’s bones<br>
<br>

<br>
In its kennel of objective certitude.<br>
And yet behind it stands a cosmic might:<br>
A measured Greatness keeps its vaster plan,<br>
A fathomless sameness rhythms the tread of life;<br>
The stars’ changeless orbits furrow inert Space,<br>
A million species follow one mute Law.<br>
A huge inertness is the world’s defence,<br>
Even in change is treasured changelessness;<br>
Into inertia revolution sinks,<br>
In a new dress the old resumes its role;<br>
The Energy acts, the stable is its seal:<br>
On Shiva’s breast is stayed the enormous dance.<br>
A fiery spirit came, next of the three.<br>
A hunchback rider of the red Wild-Ass,<br>
A rash Intelligence leaped down lion-maned<br>
From the great mystic Flame that rings the worlds<br>
And with its dire edge eats at being’s heart.<br>
Thence sprang the burning vision of Desire.<br>
A thousand shapes it wore, took numberless names:<br>
A need of multitude and uncertainty<br>
Pricks it for ever to pursue the One<br>
On countless roads across the vasts of Time<br>
Through circuits of unending difference.<br>
It burns all breasts with an ambiguous fire.<br>
A radiance gleaming on a murky stream,<br>
It flamed towards heaven, then sank, engulfed, towards hell;<br>
It climbed to drag down Truth into the mire<br>
And used for muddy ends its brilliant Force;<br>
A huge chameleon gold and blue and red<br>
Turning to black and grey and lurid brown,<br>
Hungry it stared from a mottled bough of life<br>
To snap up insect joys, its favourite food,<br>
The dingy sustenance of a sumptuous frame<br>
Nursing the splendid passion of its hues.<br>
A snake of flame with a dull cloud for tail,<br>
Followed by a dream-brood of glittering thoughts,<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
A lifted head with many-tinged flickering crests,<br>
It licked at knowledge with a smoky tongue.<br>
A whirlpool sucking in an empty air,<br>
It based on vacancy stupendous claims,<br>
In Nothingness born to Nothingness returned,<br>
Yet all the time unwittingly it drove<br>
Towards the hidden Something that is All.<br>
Ardent to find, incapable to retain,<br>
A brilliant instability was its mark,<br>
To err its inborn trend, its native cue.<br>
At once to an unreflecting credence prone,<br>
It thought all true that flattered its own hopes;<br>
It cherished golden nothings born of wish,<br>
It snatched at the unreal for provender.<br>
In darkness it discovered luminous shapes;<br>
Peering into a shadow-hung half-light<br>
It saw hued images scrawled on Fancy’s cave;<br>
Or it swept in circles through conjecture’s night<br>
And caught in imagination’s camera<br>
Bright scenes of promise held by transient flares,<br>
Fixed in life’s air the feet of hurrying dreams,<br>
Kept prints of passing Forms and hooded Powers<br>
And flash-images of half-seen verities.<br>
An eager spring to seize and to possess<br>
Unguided by reason or the seeing soul<br>
Was its first natural motion and its last,<br>
It squandered life’s force to achieve the impossible:<br>
It scorned the straight road and ran on wandering curves<br>
And left what it had won for untried things;<br>
It saw unrealised aims as instant fate<br>
And chose the precipice for its leap to heaven.<br>
Adventure its system in the gamble of life,<br>
It took fortuitous gains as safe results;<br>
Error discouraged not its confident view<br>
Ignorant of the deep law of being’s ways<br>
And failure could not slow its fiery clutch;<br>
<br>
248<br>
<br>
CANTO X: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Little Mind<br>
<br>
One chance made true warranted all the rest.<br>
Attempt, not victory, was the charm of life.<br>
An uncertain winner of uncertain stakes,<br>
Instinct its dam and the life-mind its sire,<br>
It ran its race and came in first or last.<br>
Yet were its works nor small and vain nor null;<br>
It nursed a portion of infinity’s strength<br>
And could create the high things its fancy willed;<br>
Its passion caught what calm intelligence missed.<br>
Insight of impulse laid its leaping grasp<br>
On heavens high Thought had hidden in dazzling mist,<br>
Caught glimmers that revealed a lurking sun:<br>
It probed the void and found a treasure there.<br>
A half-intuition purpled in its sense;<br>
It threw the lightning’s fork and hit the unseen.<br>
It saw in the dark and vaguely blinked in the light,<br>
Ignorance was its field, the unknown its prize.<br>
Of all these Powers the greatest was the last.<br>
Arriving late from a far plane of thought<br>
Into a packed irrational world of Chance<br>
Where all was grossly felt and blindly done,<br>
Yet the haphazard seemed the inevitable,<br>
Came Reason, the squat godhead artisan,<br>
To her narrow house upon a ridge in Time.<br>
Adept of clear contrivance and design,<br>
A pensive face and close and peering eyes,<br>
She took her firm and irremovable seat,<br>
The strongest, wisest of the troll-like Three.<br>
Armed with her lens and measuring-rod and probe,<br>
She looked upon an object universe<br>
And the multitudes that in it live and die<br>
And the body of Space and the fleeing soul of Time,<br>
And took the earth and stars into her hands<br>
To try what she could make of these strange things.<br>
In her strong purposeful laborious mind,<br>
Inventing her scheme-lines of reality<br>
<br>
249<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
And the geometric curves of her time-plan,<br>
She multiplied her slow half-cuts at Truth:<br>
Impatient of enigma and the unknown,<br>
Intolerant of the lawless and the unique,<br>
Imposing reflection on the march of Force,<br>
Imposing clarity on the unfathomable,<br>
She strove to reduce to rules the mystic world.<br>
Nothing she knew but all things hoped to know.<br>
In dark inconscient realms once void of thought,<br>
Missioned by a supreme Intelligence<br>
To throw its ray upon the obscure Vast,<br>
An imperfect light leading an erring mass<br>
By the power of sense and the idea and word,<br>
She ferrets out Nature’s process, substance, cause.<br>
All life to harmonise by thought’s control,<br>
She with the huge imbroglio struggles still;<br>
Ignorant of all but her own seeking mind<br>
To save the world from Ignorance she came.<br>
A sovereign worker through the centuries<br>
Observing and remoulding all that is,<br>
Confident she took up her stupendous charge.<br>
There the low bent and mighty figure sits<br>
Bowed under the arc-lamps of her factory home<br>
Amid the clatter and ringing of her tools.<br>
A rigorous stare in her creative eyes<br>
Coercing the plastic stuff of cosmic Mind,<br>
She sets the hard inventions of her brain<br>
In a pattern of eternal fixity:<br>
Indifferent to the cosmic dumb demand,<br>
Unconscious of too close realities,<br>
Of the unspoken thought, the voiceless heart,<br>
She leans to forge her credos and iron codes<br>
And metal structures to imprison life<br>
And mechanic models of all things that are.<br>
For the world seen she weaves a world conceived:<br>
She spins in stiff but unsubstantial lines<br>

CANTO X: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Little Mind<br>
<br>
Her gossamer word-webs of abstract thought,<br>
Her segment systems of the Infinite,<br>
Her theodicies and cosmogonic charts<br>
And myths by which she explains the inexplicable.<br>
At will she spaces in thin air of mind<br>
Like maps in the school-house of intellect hung,<br>
Forcing wide Truth into a narrow scheme,<br>
Her numberless warring strict philosophies;<br>
Out of Nature’s body of phenomenon<br>
She carves with Thought’s keen edge in rigid lines,<br>
Like rails for the World-Magician’s power to run,<br>
Her sciences precise and absolute.<br>
On the huge bare walls of human nescience<br>
Written round Nature’s deep dumb hieroglyphs<br>
She pens in clear demotic characters<br>
The vast encyclopaedia of her thoughts;<br>
An algebra of her mathematics’ signs,<br>
Her numbers and unerring formulas<br>
She builds to clinch her summary of things.<br>
On all sides runs as if in a cosmic mosque<br>
Tracing the scriptural verses of her laws<br>
The daedal of her patterned arabesques,<br>
Art of her wisdom, artifice of her lore.<br>
This art, this artifice are her only stock.<br>
In her high works of pure intelligence,<br>
In her withdrawal from the senses’ trap,<br>
There comes no breaking of the walls of mind,<br>
There leaps no rending flash of absolute power,<br>
There dawns no light of heavenly certitude.<br>
A million faces wears her knowledge here<br>
And every face is turbaned with a doubt.<br>
All now is questioned, all reduced to nought.<br>
Once monumental in their massive craft<br>
Her old great mythic writings disappear<br>
And into their place start strict ephemeral signs;<br>
This constant change spells progress to her eyes:<br>
<br>
251<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Her thought is an endless march without a goal.<br>
There is no summit on which she can stand<br>
And see in a single glance the Infinite’s whole.<br>
An inconclusive play is Reason’s toil.<br>
Each strong idea can use her as its tool;<br>
Accepting every brief she pleads her case.<br>
Open to every thought, she cannot know.<br>
The eternal Advocate seated as judge<br>
Armours in logic’s invulnerable mail<br>
A thousand combatants for Truth’s veiled throne<br>
And sets on a high horse-back of argument<br>
To tilt for ever with a wordy lance<br>
In a mock tournament where none can win.<br>
Assaying thought’s values with her rigid tests<br>
Balanced she sits on wide and empty air,<br>
Aloof and pure in her impartial poise.<br>
Absolute her judgments seem but none is sure;<br>
Time cancels all her verdicts in appeal.<br>
Although like sunbeams to our glow-worm mind<br>
Her knowledge feigns to fall from a clear heaven,<br>
Its rays are a lantern’s lustres in the Night;<br>
She throws a glittering robe on Ignorance.<br>
But now is lost her ancient sovereign claim<br>
To rule mind’s high realm in her absolute right,<br>
Bind thought with logic’s forged infallible chain<br>
Or see truth nude in a bright abstract haze.<br>
A master and slave of stark phenomenon,<br>
She travels on the roads of erring sight<br>
Or looks upon a set mechanical world<br>
Constructed for her by her instruments.<br>
A bullock yoked in the cart of proven fact,<br>
She drags huge knowledge-bales through Matter’s dust<br>
To reach utility’s immense bazaar.<br>
Apprentice she has grown to her old drudge;<br>
An aided sense is her seeking’s arbiter.<br>
This now she uses as the assayer’s stone.<br>

<br>
As if she knew not facts are husks of truth,<br>
The husks she keeps, the kernel throws aside.<br>
An ancient wisdom fades into the past,<br>
The ages’ faith becomes an idle tale,<br>
God passes out of the awakened thought,<br>
An old discarded dream needed no more:<br>
Only she seeks mechanic Nature’s keys.<br>
Interpreting stone-laws inevitable<br>
She digs into Matter’s hard concealing soil,<br>
To unearth the processes of all things done.<br>
A loaded huge self-worked machine appears<br>
To her eye’s eager and admiring stare,<br>
An intricate and meaningless enginery<br>
Of ordered fateful and unfailing Chance:<br>
Ingenious and meticulous and minute,<br>
Its brute unconscious accurate device<br>
Unrolls an unerring march, maps a sure road;<br>
It plans without thinking, acts without a will,<br>
A million purposes serves with purpose none<br>
And builds a rational world without a mind.<br>
It has no mover, no maker, no idea:<br>
Its vast self-action toils without a cause;<br>
A lifeless Energy irresistibly driven,<br>
Death’s head on the body of Necessity,<br>
Engenders life and fathers consciousness,<br>
Then wonders why all was and whence it came.<br>
Our thoughts are parts of the immense machine,<br>
Our ponderings but a freak of Matter’s law,<br>
The mystic’s lore was a fancy or a blind;<br>
Of soul or spirit we have now no need:<br>
Matter is the admirable Reality,<br>
The patent unescapable miracle,<br>
The hard truth of things, simple, eternal, sole.<br>
A suicidal rash expenditure<br>
Creating the world by a mystery of self-loss<br>
Has poured its scattered works on empty Space;<br>

Late shall the self-disintegrating Force<br>
Contract the immense expansion it has made:<br>
Then ends this mighty and unmeaning toil,<br>
The Void is left bare, vacant as before.<br>
Thus vindicated, crowned, the grand new Thought<br>
Explained the world and mastered all its laws,<br>
Touched the dumb roots, woke veiled tremendous powers;<br>
It bound to service the unconscious djinns<br>
That sleep unused in Matter’s ignorant trance.<br>
All was precise, rigid, indubitable.<br>
But when on Matter’s rock of ages based<br>
A whole stood up firm and clear-cut and safe,<br>
All staggered back into a sea of doubt;<br>
This solid scheme melted in endless flux:<br>
She had met the formless Power inventor of forms;<br>
Suddenly she stumbled upon things unseen:<br>
A lightning from the undiscovered Truth<br>
Startled her eyes with its perplexing glare<br>
And dug a gulf between the Real and Known<br>
Till all her knowledge seemed an ignorance.<br>
Once more the world was made a wonder-web,<br>
A magic’s process in a magical space,<br>
An unintelligible miracle’s depths<br>
Whose source is lost in the Ineffable.<br>
Once more we face the blank Unknowable.<br>
In a crash of values, in a huge doom-crack,<br>
In the sputter and scatter of her breaking work<br>
She lost her clear conserved constructed world.<br>
A quantum dance remained, a sprawl of chance<br>
In Energy’s stupendous tripping whirl:<br>
A ceaseless motion in the unbounded Void<br>
Invented forms without a thought or aim:<br>
Necessity and Cause were shapeless ghosts;<br>
Matter was an incident in being’s flow,<br>
Law but a clock-work habit of blind force.<br>
Ideals, ethics, systems had no base<br>

<br>
And soon collapsed or without sanction lived;<br>
All grew a chaos, a heave and clash and strife.<br>
Ideas warring and fierce leaped upon life;<br>
A hard compression held down anarchy<br>
And liberty was only a phantom’s name:<br>
Creation and destruction waltzed inarmed<br>
On the bosom of a torn and quaking earth;<br>
All reeled into a world of Kali’s dance.<br>
Thus tumbled, sinking, sprawling in the Void,<br>
Clutching for props, a soil on which to stand,<br>
She only saw a thin atomic Vast,<br>
The rare-point sparse substratum universe<br>
On which floats a solid world’s phenomenal face.<br>
Alone a process of events was there<br>
And Nature’s plastic and protean change<br>
And, strong by death to slay or to create,<br>
The riven invisible atom’s omnipotent force.<br>
One chance remained that here might be a power<br>
To liberate man from the old inadequate means<br>
And leave him sovereign of the earthly scene.<br>
For Reason then might grasp the original Force<br>
To drive her car upon the roads of Time.<br>
All then might serve the need of the thinking race,<br>
An absolute State found order’s absolute,<br>
To a standardised perfection cut all things,<br>
In society build a just exact machine.<br>
Then science and reason careless of the soul<br>
Could iron out a tranquil uniform world,<br>
Aeonic seekings glut with outward truths<br>
And a single-patterned thinking force on mind,<br>
Inflicting Matter’s logic on Spirit’s dreams<br>
A reasonable animal make of man<br>
And a symmetrical fabric of his life.<br>
This would be Nature’s peak on an obscure globe,<br>
The grand result of the long ages’ toil,<br>
Earth’s evolution crowned, her mission done.<br>
<br>
255<br>

<br>
So might it be if the spirit fell asleep;<br>
Man then might rest content and live in peace,<br>
Master of Nature who once her bondslave worked,<br>
The world’s disorder hardening into Law, —<br>
If Life’s dire heart arose not in revolt,<br>
If God within could find no greater plan.<br>
But many-visaged is the cosmic Soul;<br>
A touch can alter the fixed front of Fate.<br>
A sudden turn can come, a road appear.<br>
A greater Mind may see a greater Truth,<br>
Or we may find when all the rest has failed<br>
Hid in ourselves the key of perfect change.<br>
Ascending from the soil where creep our days,<br>
Earth’s consciousness may marry with the Sun,<br>
Our mortal life ride on the spirit’s wings,<br>
Our finite thoughts commune with the Infinite.<br>
In the bright kingdoms of the rising Sun<br>
All is a birth into a power of light:<br>
All here deformed guards there its happy shape,<br>
Here all is mixed and marred, there pure and whole;<br>
Yet each is a passing step, a moment’s phase.<br>
Awake to a greater Truth beyond her acts,<br>
The mediatrix sat and saw her works<br>
And felt the marvel in them and the force<br>
But knew the power behind the face of Time:<br>
She did the task, obeyed the knowledge given,<br>
Her deep heart yearned towards great ideal things<br>
And from the light looked out to wider light:<br>
A brilliant hedge drawn round her narrowed her power;<br>
Faithful to her limited sphere she toiled, but knew<br>
Its highest, widest seeing was a half-search,<br>
Its mightiest acts a passage or a stage.<br>
For not by Reason was creation made<br>
And not by Reason can the Truth be seen<br>
Which through the veils of thought, the screens of sense<br>
Hardly the spirit’s vision can descry<br>
<br>
256<br>

<br>
Dimmed by the imperfection of its means:<br>
The little Mind is tied to little things:<br>
Its sense is but the spirit’s outward touch,<br>
Half-waked in a world of dark Inconscience;<br>
It feels out for its beings and its forms<br>
Like one left fumbling in the ignorant Night.<br>
In this small mould of infant mind and sense<br>
Desire is a child-heart’s cry crying for bliss,<br>
Our reason only a toys’ artificer,<br>
A rule-maker in a strange stumbling game.<br>
But she her dwarf aides knew whose confident sight<br>
A bounded prospect took for the far goal.<br>
The world she has made is an interim report<br>
Of a traveller towards the half-found truth in things<br>
Moving twixt nescience and nescience.<br>
For nothing is known while aught remains concealed;<br>
The Truth is known only when all is seen.<br>
Attracted by the All that is the One,<br>
She yearns towards a higher light than hers;<br>
Hid by her cults and creeds she has glimpsed God’s face:<br>
She knows she has but found a form, a robe,<br>
But ever she hopes to see him in her heart<br>
And feel the body of his reality.<br>
As yet a mask is there and not a brow,<br>
Although sometimes two hidden eyes appear:<br>
Reason cannot tear off that glimmering mask,<br>
Her efforts only make it glimmer more;<br>
In packets she ties up the Indivisible;<br>
Finding her hands too small to hold vast Truth<br>
She breaks up knowledge into alien parts<br>
Or peers through cloud-rack for a vanished sun:<br>
She sees, not understanding what she has seen,<br>
Through the locked visages of finite things<br>
The myriad aspects of infinity.<br>
One day the Face must burn out through the mask.<br>
Our ignorance is Wisdom’s chrysalis,<br>
<br>

<br>
Our error weds new knowledge on its way,<br>
Its darkness is a blackened knot of light;<br>
Thought dances hand in hand with Nescience<br>
On the grey road that winds towards the Sun.<br>
Even while her fingers fumble at the knots<br>
Which bind them to their strange companionship,<br>
Into the moments of their married strife<br>
Sometimes break flashes of the enlightening Fire.<br>
Even now great thoughts are here that walk alone:<br>
Armed they have come with the infallible word<br>
In an investiture of intuitive light<br>
That is a sanction from the eyes of God;<br>
Announcers of a distant Truth they flame<br>
Arriving from the rim of eternity.<br>
A fire shall come out of the infinitudes,<br>
A greater Gnosis shall regard the world<br>
Crossing out of some far omniscience<br>
On lustrous seas from the still rapt Alone<br>
To illumine the deep heart of self and things.<br>
A timeless knowledge it shall bring to Mind,<br>
Its aim to life, to Ignorance its close.<br>
Above in a high breathless stratosphere,<br>
Overshadowing the dwarfish trinity,<br>
Lived, aspirants to a limitless Beyond,<br>
Captives of Space, walled by the limiting heavens,<br>
In the unceasing circuit of the hours<br>
Yearning for the straight paths of eternity,<br>
And from their high station looked down on this world<br>
Two sun-gaze Daemons witnessing all that is.<br>
A power to uplift the laggard world,<br>
Imperious rode a huge high-winged Life-Thought<br>
Unwont to tread the firm unchanging soil:<br>
Accustomed to a blue infinity,<br>
It planed in sunlit sky and starlit air;<br>
It saw afar the unreached Immortal’s home<br>

<br>
And heard afar the voices of the Gods.<br>
Iconoclast and shatterer of Time’s forts,<br>
Overleaping limit and exceeding norm,<br>
It lit the thoughts that glow through the centuries<br>
And moved to acts of superhuman force.<br>
As far as its self-winged air-planes could fly,<br>
Visiting the future in great brilliant raids<br>
It reconnoitred vistas of dream-fate.<br>
Apt to conceive, unable to attain,<br>
It drew its concept-maps and vision-plans<br>
Too large for the architecture of mortal Space.<br>
Beyond in wideness where no footing is,<br>
An imagist of bodiless Ideas,<br>
Impassive to the cry of life and sense,<br>
A pure Thought-Mind surveyed the cosmic act.<br>
Archangel of a white transcending realm,<br>
It saw the world from solitary heights<br>
Luminous in a remote and empty air.<br>

The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Mind<br>
THERE ceased the limits of the labouring Power.<br>
But being and creation cease not there.<br>
For Thought transcends the circles of mortal mind,<br>
It is greater than its earthly instrument:<br>
The godhead crammed into mind’s narrow space<br>
Escapes on every side into some vast<br>
That is a passage to infinity.<br>
It moves eternal in the spirit’s field,<br>
A runner towards the far spiritual light,<br>
A child and servant of the spirit’s force.<br>
But mind too falls back from a nameless peak.<br>
His being stretched beyond the sight of Thought.<br>
For the spirit is eternal and unmade<br>
And not by thinking was its greatness born,<br>
And not by thinking can its knowledge come.<br>
It knows itself and in itself it lives,<br>
It moves where no thought is nor any form.<br>
Its feet are steadied upon finite things,<br>
Its wings can dare to cross the Infinite.<br>
Arriving into his ken a wonder space<br>
Of great and marvellous meetings called his steps,<br>
Where Thought leaned on a Vision beyond thought<br>
And shaped a world from the Unthinkable.<br>
On peaks imagination cannot tread,<br>
In the horizons of a tireless sight,<br>
Under a blue veil of eternity<br>
The splendours of ideal Mind were seen<br>
Outstretched across the boundaries of things known.<br>
Origin of the little that we are,<br>
Instinct with the endless more that we must be,<br>
A prop of all that human strength enacts,<br>

Creator of hopes by earth unrealised,<br>
It spreads beyond the expanding universe;<br>
It wings beyond the boundaries of Dream,<br>
It overtops the ceiling of life’s soar.<br>
Awake in a luminous sphere unbound by Thought,<br>
Exposed to omniscient immensities,<br>
It casts on our world its great crowned influences,<br>
Its speed that outstrips the ambling of the hours,<br>
Its force that strides invincibly through Time,<br>
Its mights that bridge the gulf twixt man and God,<br>
Its lights that combat Ignorance and Death.<br>
In its vast ambit of ideal Space<br>
Where beauty and mightiness walk hand in hand,<br>
The Spirit’s truths take form as living Gods<br>
And each can build a world in its own right.<br>
In an air which doubt and error cannot mark<br>
With the stigmata of their deformity,<br>
In communion with the musing privacy<br>
Of a truth that sees in an unerring light<br>
Where the sight falters not nor wanders thought,<br>
Exempt from our world’s exorbitant tax of tears,<br>
Dreaming its luminous creations gaze<br>
On the Ideas that people eternity.<br>
In a sun-blaze of joy and absolute power<br>
Above the Masters of the Ideal throne<br>
In sessions of secure felicity,<br>
In regions of illumined certitude.<br>
Far are those realms from our labour and yearning and call,<br>
Perfection’s reign and hallowed sanctuary<br>
Closed to the uncertain thoughts of human mind,<br>
Remote from the turbid tread of mortal life.<br>
But since our secret selves are next of kin,<br>
A breath of unattained divinity<br>
Visits the imperfect earth on which we toil;<br>
Across a gleaming ether’s golden laugh<br>
A light falls on our vexed unsatisfied lives,<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
A thought comes down from the ideal worlds<br>
And moves us to new-model even here<br>
Some image of their greatness and appeal<br>
And wonder beyond the ken of mortal hope.<br>
Amid the heavy sameness of the days<br>
And contradicted by the human law,<br>
A faith in things that are not and must be<br>
Lives comrade of this world’s delight and pain,<br>
The child of the secret soul’s forbidden desire<br>
Born of its amour with eternity.<br>
Our spirits break free from their environment;<br>
The future brings its face of miracle near,<br>
Its godhead looks at us with present eyes;<br>
Acts deemed impossible grow natural;<br>
We feel the hero’s immortality;<br>
The courage and the strength death cannot touch<br>
Awake in limbs that are mortal, hearts that fail;<br>
We move by the rapid impulse of a will<br>
That scorns the tardy trudge of mortal time.<br>
These promptings come not from an alien sphere:<br>
Ourselves are citizens of that mother State,<br>
Adventurers, we have colonised Matter’s night.<br>
But now our rights are barred, our passports void;<br>
We live self-exiled from our heavenlier home.<br>
An errant ray from the immortal Mind<br>
Accepted the earth’s blindness and became<br>
Our human thought, servant of Ignorance.<br>
An exile, labourer on this unsure globe<br>
Captured and driven in Life’s nescient grasp,<br>
Hampered by obscure cell and treacherous nerve,<br>
It dreams of happier states and nobler powers,<br>
The natural privilege of unfallen gods,<br>
Recalling still its old lost sovereignty.<br>
Amidst earth’s mist and fog and mud and stone<br>
It still remembers its exalted sphere<br>
And the high city of its splendid birth.<br>

<br>
A memory steals in from lost heavens of Truth,<br>
A wide release comes near, a Glory calls,<br>
A might looks out, an estranged felicity.<br>
In glamorous passages of half-veiled light<br>
Wandering, a brilliant shadow of itself,<br>
This quick uncertain leader of blind gods,<br>
This tender of small lamps, this minister serf<br>
Hired by a mind and body for earth-use<br>
Forgets its work mid crude realities;<br>
It recovers its renounced imperial right,<br>
It wears once more a purple robe of thought<br>
And knows itself the Ideal’s seer and king,<br>
Communicant and prophet of the Unborn,<br>
Heir to delight and immortality.<br>
All things are real that here are only dreams,<br>
In our unknown depths sleeps their reserve of truth,<br>
On our unreached heights they reign and come to us<br>
In thought and muse trailing their robes of light.<br>
But our dwarf will and cold pragmatic sense<br>
Admit not the celestial visitants:<br>
Awaiting us on the Ideal’s peaks<br>
Or guarded in our secret self unseen<br>
Yet flashed sometimes across the awakened soul,<br>
Hide from our lives their greatness, beauty, power.<br>
Our present feels sometimes their regal touch,<br>
Our future strives towards their luminous thrones:<br>
Out of spiritual secrecy they gaze,<br>
Immortal footfalls in mind’s corridors sound:<br>
Our souls can climb into the shining planes,<br>
The breadths from which they came can be our home.<br>
His privilege regained of shadowless sight<br>
The Thinker entered the immortals’ air<br>
And drank again his pure and mighty source.<br>
Immutable in rhythmic calm and joy<br>
He saw, sovereignly free in limitless light,<br>
The unfallen planes, the thought-created worlds<br>

Where Knowledge is the leader of the act<br>
And Matter is of thinking substance made,<br>
Feeling, a heaven-bird poised on dreaming wings,<br>
Answers Truth’s call as to a parent’s voice,<br>
Form luminous leaps from the all-shaping beam<br>
And Will is a conscious chariot of the Gods,<br>
And Life, a splendour stream of musing Force,<br>
Carries the voices of the mystic Suns.<br>
A happiness it brings of whispered truth;<br>
There runs in its flow honeying the bosom of Space<br>
A laughter from the immortal heart of Bliss,<br>
And the unfathomed Joy of timelessness,<br>
The sound of Wisdom’s murmur in the Unknown<br>
And the breath of an unseen Infinity.<br>
In gleaming clarities of amethyst air<br>
The chainless and omnipotent Spirit of Mind<br>
Brooded on the blue lotus of the Idea.<br>
A gold supernal sun of timeless Truth<br>
Poured down the mystery of the eternal Ray<br>
Through a silence quivering with the word of Light<br>
On an endless ocean of discovery.<br>
Far-off he saw the joining hemispheres.<br>
On meditation’s mounting edge of trance<br>
Great stairs of thought climbed up to unborn heights<br>
Where Time’s last ridges touch eternity’s skies<br>
And Nature speaks to the spirit’s absolute.<br>
A triple realm of ordered thought came first,<br>
A small beginning of immense ascent:<br>
Above were bright ethereal skies of mind,<br>
A packed and endless soar as if sky pressed sky<br>
Buttressed against the Void on bastioned light;<br>
The highest strove to neighbour eternity,<br>
The largest widened into the infinite.<br>
But though immortal, mighty and divine,<br>
The first realms were close and kin to human mind;<br>

Their deities shape our greater thinking’s roads,<br>
A fragment of their puissance can be ours:<br>
These breadths were not too broad for our souls to range,<br>
These heights were not too high for human hope.<br>
A triple flight led to this triple world.<br>
Although abrupt for common strengths to tread,<br>
Its upward slope looks down on our earth-poise:<br>
On a slant not too precipitously steep<br>
One could turn back travelling deep descending lines<br>
To commune with the mortal’s universe.<br>
The mighty wardens of the ascending stair<br>
Who intercede with the all-creating Word,<br>
There waited for the pilgrim heaven-bound soul;<br>
Holding the thousand keys of the Beyond<br>
They proffered their knowledge to the climbing mind<br>
And filled the life with Thought’s immensities.<br>

The flame-bright hierarchs of the divine Truth,<br>
Interpreters between man’s mind and God’s,<br>
They bring the immortal fire to mortal men.<br>
Iridescent, bodying the invisible,<br>
The guardians of the Eternal’s bright degrees<br>
Fronted the Sun in radiant phalanxes.<br>
Afar they seemed a symbol imagery,<br>
Illumined originals of the shadowy script<br>
In which our sight transcribes the ideal Ray,<br>
Or icons figuring a mystic Truth,<br>
But, nearer, Gods and living Presences.<br>
A march of friezes marked the lowest steps;<br>
Fantastically ornate and richly small,<br>
They had room for the whole meaning of a world,<br>
Symbols minute of its perfection’s joy,<br>
Strange beasts that were Nature’s forces made alive<br>
And, wakened to the wonder of his role,<br>
Man grown an image undefaced of God<br>
And objects the fine coin of Beauty’s reign;<br>

This wide world-kindergarten of young souls<br>
Where the infant spirit learns through mind and sense<br>
To read the letters of the cosmic script<br>
And study the body of the cosmic self<br>
And search for the secret meaning of the whole.<br>

Persuading Nature into visible moods<br>
They lend a finite shape to infinite things.<br>
Each power that leaps from the Unmanifest<br>
Leaving the largeness of the Eternal’s peace<br>

And compelled to accept its posture and its line<br>

And hedged into a curt horizon’s arc<br>
The irised vision of the Ineffable.<br>

Forgotten was her eyelashes’ dream-print<br>
Carrying on their curve infinity’s dreams,<br>
Lost the alluring marvel of her eyes;<br>
The surging wave-throbs of her vast sea-heart<br>
They bound to a theorem of ordered beats:<br>
Her deep designs which from herself she had veiled<br>
Bowed self-revealed in their confessional.<br>
For the birth and death of the worlds they fixed a date,<br>
The diameter of infinity was drawn,<br>
Measured the distant arc of the unseen heights<br>
And visualised the plumbless viewless depths,<br>
Till all seemed known that in all time could be.<br>

<br>
All was coerced by number, name and form;<br>
Nothing was left untold, incalculable.<br>
Yet was their wisdom circled with a nought:<br>
Truths they could find and hold but not the one Truth:<br>
The Highest was to them unknowable.<br>
By knowing too much they missed the whole to be known:<br>
The fathomless heart of the world was left unguessed<br>
And the Transcendent kept its secrecy.<br>
In a sublimer and more daring soar<br>
To the wide summit of the triple stairs<br>
Bare steps climbed up like flaming rocks of gold<br>
Burning their way to a pure absolute sky.<br>
August and few the sovereign Kings of Thought<br>
Have made of Space their wide all-seeing gaze<br>
Surveying the enormous work of Time:<br>
A breadth of all-containing Consciousness<br>
Supported Being in a still embrace.<br>
Intercessors with a luminous Unseen,<br>
They capt in the long passage to the world<br>
The imperatives of the creator Self<br>
Obeyed by unknowing earth, by conscious heaven;<br>
Their thoughts are partners in its vast control.<br>
A great all-ruling Consciousness is there<br>
And Mind unwitting serves a higher Power;<br>
It is a channel, not the source of all.<br>
The cosmos is no accident in Time;<br>
There is a meaning in each play of Chance,<br>
There is a freedom in each face of Fate.<br>
A Wisdom knows and guides the mysteried world;<br>
A Truth-gaze shapes its beings and events;<br>
A Word self-born upon creation’s heights,<br>
Voice of the Eternal in the temporal spheres,<br>
Prophet of the seeings of the Absolute,<br>
Sows the Idea’s significance in Form<br>
And from that seed the growths of Time arise.<br>
On peaks beyond our ken the All-Wisdom sits:<br>

<br>
A single and infallible look comes down,<br>
A silent touch from the supernal’s air<br>
Awakes to ignorant knowledge in its acts<br>
The secret power in the inconscient depths,<br>
Compelling the blinded Godhead to emerge,<br>
Determining Necessity’s nude dance<br>
As she passes through the circuit of the hours<br>
And vanishes from the chase of finite eyes<br>
Down circling vistas of aeonic Time.<br>
The unseizable forces of the cosmic whirl<br>
Bear in their bacchant limbs the fixity<br>
Of an original foresight that is Fate.<br>
Even Nature’s ignorance is Truth’s instrument;<br>
Our struggling ego cannot change her course:<br>
Yet is it a conscious power that moves in us,<br>
A seed-idea is parent of our acts<br>
And destiny the unrecognised child of Will.<br>
Infallibly by Truth’s directing gaze<br>
All creatures here their secret self disclose,<br>
Forced to become what in themselves they hide.<br>
For He who Is grows manifest in the years<br>
And the slow Godhead shut within the cell<br>
Climbs from the plasm to immortality.<br>
But hidden, but denied to mortal grasp,<br>
Mystic, ineffable is the spirit’s truth,<br>
Unspoken, caught only by the spirit’s eye.<br>
When naked of ego and mind it hears the Voice;<br>
It looks through light to ever greater light<br>
And sees Eternity ensphering Life.<br>
This greater Truth is foreign to our thoughts;<br>
Where a free Wisdom works, they seek for a rule;<br>
Or we only see a tripping game of Chance<br>
Or a labour in chains forced by bound Nature’s law,<br>
An absolutism of dumb unthinking Power.<br>
Audacious in their sense of God-born strength<br>
These dared to grasp with their thought Truth’s absolute;<br>
<br>
272<br>
<br>
CANTO XI: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Mind<br>
<br>
By an abstract purity of godless sight,<br>
By a percept nude, intolerant of forms,<br>
They brought to Mind what Mind could never reach<br>
And hoped to conquer Truth’s supernal base.<br>
A stripped imperative of conceptual phrase<br>
Architectonic and inevitable<br>
Translated the unthinkable into thought:<br>
A silver-winged fire of naked subtle sense,<br>
An ear of mind withdrawn from the outward’s rhymes<br>
Discovered the seed-sounds of the eternal Word,<br>
The rhythm and music heard that built the worlds,<br>
And seized in things the bodiless Will to be.<br>
The Illimitable they measured with number’s rods<br>
And traced the last formula of limited things,<br>
In transparent systems bodied termless truths,<br>
The Timeless made accountable to Time<br>
And valued the incommensurable Supreme.<br>
To park and hedge the ungrasped infinitudes<br>
They erected absolute walls of thought and speech<br>
And made a vacuum to hold the One.<br>
In their sight they drove towards an empty peak,<br>
A mighty space of cold and sunlit air.<br>
To unify their task, excluding life<br>
Which cannot bear the nakedness of the Vast,<br>
They made a cipher of a multitude,<br>
In negation found the meaning of the All<br>
And in nothingness the absolute positive.<br>
A single law simplessed the cosmic theme,<br>
Compressing Nature into a formula;<br>
Their titan labour made all knowledge one,<br>
A mental algebra of the Spirit’s ways,<br>
An abstract of the living Divinity.<br>
Here the mind’s wisdom stopped; it felt complete;<br>
For nothing more was left to think or know:<br>
In a spiritual zero it sat throned<br>
And took its vast silence for the Ineffable.<br>

BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
This was the play of the bright gods of Thought.<br>
Attracting into time the timeless Light,<br>
Imprisoning eternity in the hours,<br>
This they have planned, to snare the feet of Truth<br>
In an aureate net of concept and of phrase<br>
And keep her captive for the thinker’s joy<br>
In his little world built of immortal dreams:<br>
There must she dwell mured in the human mind,<br>
An empress prisoner in her subject’s house,<br>
Adored and pure and still on his heart’s throne,<br>
His splendid property cherished and apart<br>
In the wall of silence of his secret muse,<br>
Immaculate in white virginity,<br>
The same for ever and for ever one,<br>
His worshipped changeless Goddess through all time.<br>
Or else, a faithful consort of his mind<br>
Assenting to his nature and his will,<br>
She sanctions and inspires his words and acts<br>
Prolonging their resonance through the listening years,<br>
Companion and recorder of his march<br>
Crossing a brilliant tract of thought and life<br>
Carved out of the eternity of Time.<br>
A witness to his high triumphant star,<br>
Her godhead servitor to a crowned Idea,<br>
He shall dominate by her a prostrate world;<br>
A warrant for his deeds and his beliefs,<br>
She attests his right divine to lead and rule.<br>
Or as a lover clasps his one beloved,<br>
Godhead of his life’s worship and desire,<br>
Icon of his heart’s sole idolatry,<br>
She now is his and must live for him alone:<br>
She has invaded him with her sudden bliss,<br>
An exhaustless marvel in his happy grasp,<br>
An allurement, a caught ravishing miracle.<br>
Her now he claims after long rapt pursuit,<br>
The one joy of his body and his soul:<br>
<br>
274<br>
<br>
CANTO XI: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Mind<br>
<br>
Inescapable is her divine appeal,<br>
Her immense possession an undying thrill,<br>
An intoxication and an ecstasy:<br>
The passion of her self-revealing moods,<br>
A heavenly glory and variety,<br>
Makes ever new her body to his eyes,<br>
Or else repeats the first enchantment’s touch,<br>
The luminous rapture of her mystic breasts<br>
And beautiful vibrant limbs a living field<br>
Of throbbing new discovery without end.<br>
A new beginning flowers in word and laugh,<br>
A new charm brings back the old extreme delight:<br>
He is lost in her, she is his heaven here.<br>
Truth smiled upon the gracious golden game.<br>
Out of her hushed eternal spaces leaned<br>
The great and boundless Goddess feigned to yield<br>
The sunlit sweetness of her secrecies.<br>
Incarnating her beauty in his clasp<br>
She gave for a brief kiss her immortal lips<br>
And drew to her bosom one glorified mortal head:<br>
She made earth her home, for whom heaven was too small.<br>
In a human breast her occult presence lived;<br>
He carved from his own self his figure of her:<br>
She shaped her body to a mind’s embrace.<br>
Into thought’s narrow limits she has come;<br>
Her greatness she has suffered to be pressed<br>
Into the little cabin of the Idea,<br>
The closed room of a lonely thinker’s grasp:<br>
She has lowered her heights to the stature of our souls<br>
And dazzled our lids with her celestial gaze.<br>
Thus each is satisfied with his high gain<br>
And thinks himself beyond mortality blest,<br>
A king of truth upon his separate throne.<br>
To her possessor in the field of Time<br>
A single splendour caught from her glory seems<br>
The one true light, her beauty’s glowing whole.<br>

But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth:<br>
The whole world lives in a lonely ray of her sun.<br>
In our thinking’s close and narrow lamp-lit house<br>
The vanity of our shut mortal mind<br>
Dreams that the chains of thought have made her ours;<br>
But only we play with our own brilliant bonds;<br>
Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie.<br>
In our hypnosis by one luminous point<br>
We see not what small figure of her we hold;<br>
We feel not her inspiring boundlessness,<br>
We share not her immortal liberty.<br>
Thus is it even with the seer and sage;<br>
For still the human limits the divine:<br>
Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight,<br>
Breathe her divine illimitable air,<br>
Her simple vast supremacy confess,<br>
Dare to surrender to her absolute.<br>
Then the Unmanifest reflects his form<br>
In the still mind as in a living glass;<br>
The timeless Ray descends into our hearts<br>
And we are rapt into eternity.<br>
For Truth is wider, greater than her forms.<br>
A thousand icons they have made of her<br>
And find her in the idols they adore;<br>
But she remains herself and infinite.<br>

The Heavens of the Ideal<br>
ALWAYS the Ideal beckoned from afar.<br>
Awakened by the touch of the Unseen,<br>
Deserting the boundary of things achieved,<br>
Aspired the strong discoverer, tireless Thought,<br>
Revealing at each step a luminous world.<br>
It left known summits for the unknown peaks:<br>
Impassioned, it sought the lone unrealised Truth,<br>
It longed for the Light that knows not death and birth.<br>
Each stage of the soul’s remote ascent was built<br>
Into a constant heaven felt always here.<br>
At each pace of the journey marvellous<br>
A new degree of wonder and of bliss,<br>
A new rung formed in Being’s mighty stair,<br>
A great wide step trembling with jewelled fire<br>
As if a burning spirit quivered there<br>
Upholding with his flame the immortal hope,<br>
As if a radiant God had given his soul<br>
That he might feel the tread of pilgrim feet<br>
Mounting in haste to the Eternal’s house.<br>
At either end of each effulgent stair<br>
The heavens of the ideal Mind were seen<br>
In a blue lucency of dreaming Space<br>
Like strips of brilliant sky clinging to the moon.<br>
On one side glimmered hue on floating hue,<br>
A glory of sunrise breaking on the soul,<br>
In a tremulous rapture of the heart’s insight<br>
And the spontaneous bliss that beauty gives,<br>
The lovely kingdoms of the deathless Rose.<br>
Above the spirit cased in mortal sense<br>
Are superconscious realms of heavenly peace,<br>
Below, the Inconscient’s sullen dim abyss,<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
Between, behind our life, the deathless Rose.<br>
Across the covert air the spirit breathes,<br>
A body of the cosmic beauty and joy<br>
Unseen, unguessed by the blind suffering world,<br>
Climbing from Nature’s deep surrendered heart<br>
It blooms for ever at the feet of God,<br>
Fed by life’s sacrificial mysteries.<br>
Here too its bud is born in human breasts;<br>
Then by a touch, a presence or a voice<br>
The world is turned into a temple ground<br>
And all discloses the unknown Beloved.<br>
In an outburst of heavenly joy and ease<br>
Life yields to the divinity within<br>
And gives the rapture-offering of its all,<br>
And the soul opens to felicity.<br>
A bliss is felt that never can wholly cease,<br>
A sudden mystery of secret Grace<br>
Flowers goldening our earth of red desire.<br>
All the high gods who hid their visages<br>
From the soiled passionate ritual of our hopes,<br>
Reveal their names and their undying powers.<br>
A fiery stillness wakes the slumbering cells,<br>
A passion of the flesh becoming spirit,<br>
And marvellously is fulfilled at last<br>
The miracle for which our life was made.<br>
A flame in a white voiceless cupola<br>
Is seen and faces of immortal light,<br>
The radiant limbs that know not birth and death,<br>
The breasts that suckle the first-born of the Sun,<br>
The wings that crowd thought’s ardent silences,<br>
The eyes that look into spiritual Space.<br>
Our hidden centres of celestial force<br>
Open like flowers to a heavenly atmosphere;<br>
Mind pauses thrilled with the supernal Ray,<br>
And even this transient body then can feel<br>
Ideal love and flawless happiness<br>

And laughter of the heart’s sweetness and delight<br>
Freed from the rude and tragic hold of Time,<br>
And beauty and the rhythmic feet of the hours.<br>

What here is in the bud has blossomed there.<br>
There is the secrecy of the House of Flame,<br>
The blaze of godlike thought and golden bliss,<br>
The rapt idealism of heavenly sense;<br>
There are the wonderful voices, the sun-laugh,<br>
A gurgling eddy in rivers of God’s joy,<br>
And the mysteried vineyards of the gold moon-wine,<br>
All the fire and sweetness of which hardly here<br>
A brilliant shadow visits mortal life.<br>
Although are witnessed there the joys of Time,<br>
Pressed on the bosom the Immortal’s touch is felt,<br>
Heard are the flutings of the Infinite.<br>
Here upon earth are early awakenings,<br>
Moments that tremble in an air divine,<br>
And grown upon the yearning of her soil<br>
Time’s sun-flowers’ gaze at gold Eternity:<br>
There are the imperishable beatitudes.<br>
A million lotuses swaying on one stem,<br>
World after coloured and ecstatic world<br>
Climbs towards some far unseen epiphany.<br>
On the other side of the eternal stairs<br>
The mighty kingdoms of the deathless Flame<br>
Aspired to reach the Being’s absolutes.<br>
Out of the sorrow and darkness of the world,<br>
Out of the depths where life and thought are tombed,<br>
Lonely mounts up to heaven the deathless Flame.<br>
In a veiled Nature’s hallowed secrecies<br>
It burns for ever on the altar Mind,<br>
Its priests the souls of dedicated gods,<br>
Humanity its house of sacrifice.<br>
Once kindled, never can its flamings cease.<br>
A fire along the mystic paths of earth,<br>

It rises through the mortal’s hemisphere,<br>
Till borne by runners of the Day and Dusk<br>
It enters the occult eternal Light<br>
And clambers whitening to the invisible Throne.<br>
Its worlds are steps of an ascending Force:<br>
A dream of giant contours, titan lines,<br>
Homes of unfallen and illumined Might,<br>
Heavens of unchanging Good pure and unborn,<br>
Heights of the grandeur of Truth’s ageless ray,<br>
As in a symbol sky they start to view<br>
And call our souls into a vaster air.<br>
On their summits they bear up the sleepless Flame;<br>
Dreaming of a mysterious Beyond,<br>
Transcendent of the paths of Fate and Time,<br>
They point above themselves with index peaks<br>
Through a pale-sapphire ether of god-mind<br>
Towards some gold Infinite’s apocalypse.<br>
A thunder rolling mid the hills of God,<br>
Tireless, severe is their tremendous Voice:<br>
Exceeding us, to exceed ourselves they call<br>
And bid us rise incessantly above.<br>
Far from our eager reach those summits live,<br>
Too lofty for our mortal strength and height,<br>
Hardly in a dire ecstasy of toil<br>
Climbed by the spirit’s naked athlete will.<br>
Austere, intolerant they claim from us<br>
Efforts too lasting for our mortal nerve<br>
Our hearts cannot cleave to nor our flesh support;<br>
Only the Eternal’s strength in us can dare<br>
To attempt the immense adventure of that climb<br>
And the sacrifice of all we cherish here.<br>
Our human knowledge is a candle burnt<br>
On a dim altar to a sun-vast Truth;<br>
Man’s virtue, a coarse-spun ill-fitting dress,<br>
Apparels wooden images of Good;<br>
Passionate and blinded, bleeding, stained with mire<br>

An imperfection dogs our highest strength;<br>
Portions and pale reflections are our share.<br>
Happy the worlds that have not felt our fall,<br>
Where Will is one with Truth and Good with Power;<br>
Impoverished not by earth-mind’s indigence,<br>
They keep God’s natural breath of mightiness,<br>
His bare spontaneous swift intensities;<br>
There is his great transparent mirror, Self,<br>
And there his sovereign autarchy of bliss<br>
In which immortal natures have their part,<br>
Heirs and cosharers of divinity.<br>
He through the Ideal’s kingdoms moved at will,<br>
Accepted their beauty and their greatness bore,<br>
Partook of the glories of their wonder fields,<br>
But passed nor stayed beneath their splendour’s rule.<br>
All there was an intense but partial light.<br>
In each a seraph-winged high-browed Idea<br>
United all knowledge by one master thought,<br>
Persuaded all action to one golden sense,<br>
All powers subjected to a single power<br>
And made a world where it could reign alone,<br>
An absolute ideal’s perfect home.<br>
Insignia of their victory and their faith,<br>
They offered to the Traveller at their gates<br>
A quenchless flame or an unfading flower,<br>
Emblem of a high kingdom’s privilege.<br>
A glorious shining Angel of the Way<br>
Presented to the seeking of the soul<br>
The sweetness and the might of an idea,<br>
Each deemed Truth’s intimate fount and summit force,<br>
The heart of the meaning of the universe,<br>
Perfection’s key, passport to Paradise.<br>
Yet were there regions where these absolutes met<br>
And made a circle of bliss with married hands;<br>

But none in the other would his body lose<br>
To find his soul in the world’s single Soul,<br>
A multiplied rapture of infinity.<br>
Onward he passed to a diviner sphere:<br>
There, joined in a common greatness, light and bliss,<br>
All high and beautiful and desirable powers<br>
Forgetting their difference and their separate reign<br>
Become a single multitudinous whole.<br>

In the Self of Mind<br>
AT LAST there came a bare indifferent sky<br>
Where Silence listened to the cosmic Voice,<br>
But answered nothing to a million calls;<br>
The soul’s endless question met with no response.<br>
An abrupt conclusion ended eager hopes,<br>
A deep cessation in a mighty calm,<br>
A finis-line on the last page of thought<br>
And a margin and a blank of wordless peace.<br>
There paused the climbing hierarchy of worlds.<br>
He stood on a wide arc of summit Space<br>
Alone with an enormous Self of Mind<br>
Which held all life in a corner of its vasts.<br>
Omnipotent, immobile and aloof,<br>
In the world which sprang from it, it took no part:<br>
It gave no heed to the paeans of victory,<br>
It was indifferent to its own defeats,<br>
It heard the cry of grief and made no sign;<br>
Impartial fell its gaze on evil and good,<br>
It saw destruction come and did not move.<br>
An equal Cause of things, a lonely Seer<br>
And Master of its multitude of forms,<br>
It acted not but bore all thoughts and deeds,<br>
The witness Lord of Nature’s myriad acts<br>
Consenting to the movements of her Force.<br>
His mind reflected this vast quietism.<br>
This witness hush is the Thinker’s secret base:<br>
Hidden in silent depths the word is formed,<br>
From hidden silences the act is born<br>
Into the voiceful mind, the labouring world;<br>
In secrecy wraps the seed the Eternal sows<br>
Silence, the mystic birthplace of the soul.<br>

<br>
In God’s supreme withdrawn and timeless hush<br>
A seeing Self and potent Energy met;<br>
The Silence knew itself and thought took form:<br>
Self-made from the dual power creation rose.<br>
In the still self he lived and it in him;<br>
Its mute immemorable listening depths,<br>
Its vastness and its stillness were his own;<br>
One being with it he grew wide, powerful, free.<br>
Apart, unbound, he looked on all things done.<br>
As one who builds his own imagined scenes<br>
And loses not himself in what he sees,<br>
Spectator of a drama self-conceived,<br>
He looked on the world and watched its motive thoughts<br>
With the burden of luminous prophecy in their eyes,<br>
Its forces with their feet of wind and fire<br>
Arisen from the dumbness in his soul.<br>
All now he seemed to understand and know;<br>
Desire came not nor any gust of will,<br>
The great perturbed inquirer lost his task;<br>
Nothing was asked nor wanted any more.<br>
There he could stay, the Self, the Silence won:<br>
His soul had peace, it knew the cosmic Whole.<br>
Then suddenly a luminous finger fell<br>
On all things seen or touched or heard or felt<br>
And showed his mind that nothing could be known;<br>
That must be reached from which all knowledge comes.<br>
The sceptic Ray disrupted all that seems<br>
And smote at the very roots of thought and sense.<br>
In a universe of Nescience they have grown,<br>
Aspiring towards a superconscient Sun,<br>
Playing in shine and rain from heavenlier skies<br>
They never can win however high their reach<br>
Or overpass however keen their probe.<br>
A doubt corroded even the means to think,<br>
Distrust was thrown upon Mind’s instruments;<br>
All that it takes for reality’s shining coin,<br>

Firm theory, assured significance,<br>
Appeared as frauds upon Time’s credit bank<br>
Or assets valueless in Truth’s treasury.<br>
An Ignorance on an uneasy throne<br>
Travestied with a fortuitous sovereignty<br>
A figure of knowledge garbed in dubious words<br>
And tinsel thought-forms brightly inadequate.<br>
A labourer in the dark dazzled by half-light,<br>
What it knew was an image in a broken glass,<br>
What it saw was real but its sight untrue.<br>
All the ideas in its vast repertory<br>
Were like the mutterings of a transient cloud<br>
That spent itself in sound and left no trace.<br>
A frail house hanging in uncertain air,<br>
The thin ingenious web round which it moves,<br>
Put out awhile on the tree of the universe,<br>
And gathered up into itself again,<br>
Was only a trap to catch life’s insect food,<br>
Winged thoughts that flutter fragile in brief light<br>
But dead, once captured in fixed forms of mind,<br>
Aims puny but looming large in man’s small scale,<br>
Flickers of imagination’s brilliant gauze<br>
And cobweb-wrapped beliefs alive no more.<br>
The magic hut of built-up certitudes<br>
Made out of glittering dust and bright moonshine<br>
In which it shrines its image of the Real,<br>
Collapsed into the Nescience whence it rose.<br>
Only a gleam was there of symbol facts<br>
That shroud the mystery lurking in their glow,<br>
And falsehoods based on hidden realities<br>
By which they live until they fall from Time.<br>
Our mind is a house haunted by the slain past,<br>
Ideas soon mummified, ghosts of old truths,<br>
God’s spontaneities tied with formal strings<br>
And packed into drawers of reason’s trim bureau,<br>

Or an office for misuse of soul and life<br>
And all the waste man makes of heaven’s gifts<br>
And all his squanderings of Nature’s store,<br>
A stage for the comedy of Ignorance.<br>
The world seemed a long aeonic failure’s scene:<br>
All sterile grew, no base was left secure.<br>
Assailed by the edge of the convicting beam<br>
The builder Reason lost her confidence<br>
In the successful sleight and turn of thought<br>
That makes the soul the prisoner of a phrase.<br>
Its highest wisdom was a brilliant guess,<br>
Its mighty structured science of the worlds<br>
A passing light on being’s surfaces.<br>
There was nothing there but a schema drawn by sense,<br>
A substitute for eternal mysteries,<br>
A scrawl figure of reality, a plan<br>
And elevation by the architect Word<br>
Imposed upon the semblances of Time.<br>
Existence’ self was shadowed by a doubt;<br>
Almost it seemed a lotus-leaf afloat<br>
On a nude pool of cosmic Nothingness.<br>
This great spectator and creator Mind<br>
Was only some half-seeing’s delegate,<br>
A veil that hung between the soul and Light,<br>
An idol, not the living body of God.<br>
Even the still spirit that looks upon its works<br>
Was some pale front of the Unknowable;<br>
A shadow seemed the wide and witness Self,<br>
Its liberation and immobile calm<br>
A void recoil of being from Time-made things,<br>
Not the self-vision of Eternity.<br>
Deep peace was there, but not the nameless Force:<br>
Our sweet and mighty Mother was not there<br>
Who gathers to her bosom her children’s lives,<br>
Her clasp that takes the world into her arms<br>

In contrary patterns and conflicting hues;<br>
A part-experience fragmented the Whole.<br>
He looked above, but all was blank and still:<br>
A sapphire firmament of abstract Thought<br>
Escaped into a formless Vacancy.<br>
He looked below, but all was dark and mute.<br>
A noise was heard, between, of thought and prayer,<br>
A strife, a labour without end or pause;<br>
A vain and ignorant seeking raised its voice.<br>
A rumour and a movement and a call,<br>
A foaming mass, a cry innumerable<br>
Rolled ever upon the ocean surge of Life<br>
Along the coasts of mortal Ignorance.<br>
On its unstable and enormous breast<br>
Beings and forces, forms, ideas like waves<br>
Jostled for figure and supremacy,<br>
And rose and sank and rose again in Time;<br>
And at the bottom of the sleepless stir,<br>
A Nothingness parent of the struggling worlds,<br>
A huge creator Death, a mystic Void,<br>
For ever sustaining the irrational cry,<br>
For ever excluding the supernal Word,<br>
Motionless, refusing question and response,<br>
Reposed beneath the voices and the march<br>
The dim Inconscient’s dumb incertitude.<br>
Two firmaments of darkness and of light<br>
Opposed their limits to the spirit’s walk;<br>

It moved veiled in from Self’s infinity<br>
In a world of beings and momentary events<br>
Where all must die to live and live to die.<br>
Immortal by renewed mortality,<br>
It wandered in the spiral of its acts<br>
Or ran around the cycles of its thought,<br>
Yet was no more than its original self<br>
And knew no more than when it first began.<br>
To be was a prison, extinction the escape.<br>

The World-Soul<br>
A COVERT answer to his seeking came.<br>
In a far shimmering background of Mind-Space<br>
A glowing mouth was seen, a luminous shaft;<br>
A recluse gate it seemed, musing on joy,<br>
A veiled retreat and escape to mystery.<br>
Away from the unsatisfied surface world<br>
It fled into the bosom of the unknown,<br>
A well, a tunnel of the depths of God.<br>
It plunged as if a mystic groove of hope<br>
Through many layers of formless voiceless self<br>
To reach the last profound of the world’s heart,<br>
And from that heart there surged a wordless call<br>
Pleading with some still impenetrable Mind,<br>
Voicing some passionate unseen desire.<br>
As if a beckoning finger of secrecy<br>
Outstretched into a crystal mood of air,<br>
Pointing at him from some near hidden depth,<br>
As if a message from the world’s deep soul,<br>
An intimation of a lurking joy<br>
That flowed out from a cup of brooding bliss,<br>
There shimmered stealing out into the Mind<br>
A mute and quivering ecstasy of light,<br>
A passion and delicacy of roseate fire.<br>
As one drawn to his lost spiritual home<br>
Feels now the closeness of a waiting love,<br>
Into a passage dim and tremulous<br>
That clasped him in from day and night’s pursuit,<br>
He travelled led by a mysterious sound.<br>
A murmur multitudinous and lone,<br>
All sounds it was in turn, yet still the same.<br>
A hidden call to unforeseen delight<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
In the summoning voice of one long-known, well-loved,<br>
But nameless to the unremembering mind,<br>
It led to rapture back the truant heart.<br>
The immortal cry ravished the captive ear.<br>
Then, lowering its imperious mystery,<br>
It sank to a whisper circling round the soul.<br>
It seemed the yearning of a lonely flute<br>
That roamed along the shores of memory<br>
And filled the eyes with tears of longing joy.<br>
A cricket’s rash and fiery single note,<br>
It marked with shrill melody night’s moonless hush<br>
And beat upon a nerve of mystic sleep<br>
Its high insistent magical reveille.<br>
A jingling silver laugh of anklet bells<br>
Travelled the roads of a solitary heart;<br>
Its dance solaced an eternal loneliness:<br>
An old forgotten sweetness sobbing came.<br>
Or from a far harmonious distance heard<br>
The tinkling pace of a long caravan<br>
It seemed at times, or a vast forest’s hymn,<br>
The solemn reminder of a temple gong,<br>
A bee-croon honey-drunk in summer isles<br>
Ardent with ecstasy in a slumbrous noon,<br>
Or the far anthem of a pilgrim sea.<br>
An incense floated in the quivering air,<br>
A mystic happiness trembled in the breast<br>
As if the invisible Beloved had come<br>
Assuming the sudden loveliness of a face<br>
And close glad hands could seize his fugitive feet<br>
And the world change with the beauty of a smile.<br>
Into a wonderful bodiless realm he came,<br>
The home of a passion without name or voice,<br>
A depth he felt answering to every height,<br>
A nook was found that could embrace all worlds,<br>
A point that was the conscious knot of Space,<br>
An hour eternal in the heart of Time.<br>

CANTO XIV: The World-Soul<br>
<br>
The silent Soul of all the world was there:<br>
A Being lived, a Presence and a Power,<br>
A single Person who was himself and all<br>
And cherished Nature’s sweet and dangerous throbs<br>
Transfigured into beats divine and pure.<br>
One who could love without return for love,<br>
Meeting and turning to the best the worst,<br>
It healed the bitter cruelties of earth,<br>
Transforming all experience to delight;<br>
Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth<br>
It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child<br>
And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy;<br>
It led things evil towards their secret good,<br>
It turned racked falsehood into happy truth;<br>
Its power was to reveal divinity.<br>
Infinite, coeval with the mind of God,<br>
It bore within itself a seed, a flame,<br>
A seed from which the Eternal is new-born,<br>
A flame that cancels death in mortal things.<br>
All grew to all kindred and self and near;<br>
The intimacy of God was everywhere,<br>
No veil was felt, no brute barrier inert,<br>
Distance could not divide, Time could not change.<br>
A fire of passion burned in spirit-depths,<br>
A constant touch of sweetness linked all hearts,<br>
The throb of one adoration’s single bliss<br>
In a rapt ether of undying love.<br>
An inner happiness abode in all,<br>
A sense of universal harmonies,<br>
A measureless secure eternity<br>
Of truth and beauty and good and joy made one.<br>
Here was the welling core of finite life;<br>
A formless spirit became the soul of form.<br>
All there was soul or made of sheer soul-stuff;<br>
A sky of soul covered a deep soul-ground.<br>
<br>
291<br>
<br>
BOOK II: The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds<br>
<br>
All here was known by a spiritual sense:<br>
Thought was not there but a knowledge near and one<br>
Seized on all things by a moved identity,<br>
A sympathy of self with other selves,<br>
The touch of consciousness on consciousness<br>
And being’s look on being with inmost gaze<br>
And heart laid bare to heart without walls of speech<br>
And the unanimity of seeing minds<br>
In myriad forms luminous with the one God.<br>
Life was not there, but an impassioned force,<br>
Finer than fineness, deeper than the deeps,<br>
Felt as a subtle and spiritual power,<br>
A quivering out from soul to answering soul,<br>
A mystic movement, a close influence,<br>
A free and happy and intense approach<br>
Of being to being with no screen or check,<br>
Without which life and love could never have been.<br>
Body was not there, for bodies were needed not,<br>
The soul itself was its own deathless form<br>
And met at once the touch of other souls<br>
Close, blissful, concrete, wonderfully true.<br>
As when one walks in sleep through luminous dreams<br>
And, conscious, knows the truth their figures mean,<br>
Here where reality was its own dream,<br>
He knew things by their soul and not their shape:<br>
As those who have lived long made one in love<br>
Need word nor sign for heart’s reply to heart,<br>
He met and communed without bar of speech<br>
With beings unveiled by a material frame.<br>
There was a strange spiritual scenery,<br>
A loveliness of lakes and streams and hills,<br>
A flow, a fixity in a soul-space,<br>
And plains and valleys, stretches of soul-joy,<br>
And gardens that were flower-tracts of the spirit,<br>
Its meditations of tinged reverie.<br>
Air was the breath of a pure infinite.<br>

A fragrance wandered in a coloured haze<br>
As if the scent and hue of all sweet flowers<br>
Had mingled to copy heaven’s atmosphere.<br>
Appealing to the soul and not the eye<br>
Beauty lived there at home in her own house,<br>
There all was beautiful by its own right<br>
And needed not the splendour of a robe.<br>
All objects were like bodies of the Gods,<br>
A spirit symbol environing a soul,<br>
For world and self were one reality.<br>
Immersed in voiceless internatal trance<br>
The beings that once wore forms on earth sat there<br>
In shining chambers of spiritual sleep.<br>
Passed were the pillar-posts of birth and death,<br>
Passed was their little scene of symbol deeds,<br>
Passed were the heavens and hells of their long road;<br>
They had returned into the world’s deep soul.<br>
All now was gathered into pregnant rest:<br>
Person and nature suffered a slumber change.<br>
In trance they gathered back their bygone selves,<br>
In a background memory’s foreseeing muse<br>
Prophetic of new personality<br>
Arranged the map of their coming destiny’s course:<br>
Heirs of their past, their future’s discoverers,<br>
Electors of their own self-chosen lot,<br>
They waited for the adventure of new life.<br>
A Person persistent through the lapse of worlds,<br>
Although the same for ever in many shapes<br>
By the outward mind unrecognisable,<br>
Assuming names unknown in unknown climes<br>
Imprints through Time upon the earth’s worn page<br>
A growing figure of its secret self,<br>
And learns by experience what the spirit knew,<br>
Till it can see its truth alive and God.<br>
Once more they must face the problem-game of birth,<br>

And thought and impulse lighting the blind act,<br>
And venture on the roads of circumstance,<br>
Through inner movements and external scenes<br>
Travelling to self across the forms of things.<br>
Into creation’s centre he had come.<br>
The spirit wandering from state to state<br>
Finds here the silence of its starting-point<br>
In the formless force and the still fixity<br>
And brooding passion of the world of Soul.<br>
All that is made and once again unmade,<br>
The calm persistent vision of the One<br>
Inevitably re-makes, it lives anew:<br>
Forces and lives and beings and ideas<br>
Are taken into the stillness for a while;<br>
There they remould their purpose and their drift,<br>
Recast their nature and re-form their shape.<br>
Ever they change and changing ever grow,<br>
And passing through a fruitful stage of death<br>
And after long reconstituting sleep<br>
Resume their place in the process of the Gods<br>
Until their work in cosmic Time is done.<br>
Here was the fashioning chamber of the worlds.<br>
An interval was left twixt act and act,<br>
Twixt birth and birth, twixt dream and waking dream,<br>
A pause that gave new strength to do and be.<br>
Beyond were regions of delight and peace,<br>
Mute birthplaces of light and hope and love,<br>
And cradles of heavenly rapture and repose.<br>
In a slumber of the voices of the world<br>
He of the eternal moment grew aware;<br>
His knowledge stripped bare of the garbs of sense<br>
Knew by identity without thought or word;<br>
His being saw itself without its veils,<br>
Life’s line fell from the spirit’s infinity.<br>
Along a road of pure interior light,<br>

<br>
Alone between tremendous Presences,<br>
Under the watching eyes of nameless Gods,<br>
His soul passed on, a single conscious power,<br>
Towards the end which ever begins again,<br>
Approaching through a stillness dumb and calm<br>
To the source of all things human and divine.<br>
There he beheld in their mighty union’s poise<br>
The figure of the deathless Two-in-One,<br>
A single being in two bodies clasped,<br>
A diarchy of two united souls,<br>
Seated absorbed in deep creative joy;<br>
Their trance of bliss sustained the mobile world.<br>
Behind them in a morning dusk One stood<br>
Who brought them forth from the Unknowable.<br>
Ever disguised she awaits the seeking spirit;<br>
Watcher on the supreme unreachable peaks,<br>
Guide of the traveller of the unseen paths,<br>
She guards the austere approach to the Alone.<br>
At the beginning of each far-spread plane<br>
Pervading with her power the cosmic suns<br>
She reigns, inspirer of its multiple works<br>
And thinker of the symbol of its scene.<br>
Above them all she stands supporting all,<br>
The sole omnipotent Goddess ever-veiled<br>
Of whom the world is the inscrutable mask;<br>
The ages are the footfalls of her tread,<br>
Their happenings the figure of her thoughts,<br>
And all creation is her endless act.<br>
His spirit was made a vessel of her force;<br>
Mute in the fathomless passion of his will<br>
He outstretched to her his folded hands of prayer.<br>
Then in a sovereign answer to his heart<br>
A gesture came as of worlds thrown away,<br>
And from her raiment’s lustrous mystery raised<br>
One arm half-parted the eternal veil.<br>
A light appeared still and imperishable.<br>

Attracted to the large and luminous depths<br>
Of the ravishing enigma of her eyes,<br>
He saw the mystic outline of a face.<br>
Overwhelmed by her implacable light and bliss,<br>
An atom of her illimitable self<br>
Mastered by the honey and lightning of her power,<br>
Tossed towards the shores of her ocean-ecstasy,<br>
Drunk with a deep golden spiritual wine,<br>
He cast from the rent stillness of his soul<br>
A cry of adoration and desire<br>
And the surrender of his boundless mind<br>
And the self-giving of his silent heart.<br>
He fell down at her feet unconscious, prone.<br>

AFTER a measureless moment of the soul<br>
Again returning to these surface fields<br>
Out of the timeless depths where he had sunk,<br>
He heard once more the slow tread of the hours.<br>
All once perceived and lived was far away;<br>
Himself was to himself his only scene.<br>
Above the Witness and his universe<br>
He stood in a realm of boundless silences<br>
Awaiting the Voice that spoke and built the worlds.<br>
A light was round him wide and absolute,<br>
A diamond purity of eternal sight;<br>
A consciousness lay still, devoid of forms,<br>
Free, wordless, uncoerced by sign or rule,<br>
For ever content with only being and bliss;<br>
A sheer existence lived in its own peace<br>
On the single spirit’s bare and infinite ground.<br>
Out of the sphere of Mind he had arisen,<br>
He had left the reign of Nature’s hues and shades;<br>
He dwelt in his self’s colourless purity.<br>
It was a plane of undetermined spirit<br>
That could be a zero or round sum of things,<br>
A state in which all ceased and all began.<br>
All it became that figures the absolute,<br>
A high vast peak whence Spirit could see the worlds,<br>
Calm’s wide epiphany, wisdom’s mute home,<br>
A lonely station of Omniscience,<br>
A diving-board of the Eternal’s power,<br>
A white floor in the house of All-Delight.<br>
Here came the thought that passes beyond Thought,<br>
Here the still Voice which our listening cannot hear,<br>
The Knowledge by which the knower is the known,<br>

A thousand roads leaped into Eternity<br>
Or singing ran to meet God’s veilless face.<br>
The Known released him from its limiting chain;<br>
He knocked at the doors of the Unknowable.<br>
Thence gazing with an immeasurable outlook<br>
One with self’s inlook into its own pure vasts,<br>
He saw the splendour of the spirit’s realms,<br>
The greatness and wonder of its boundless works,<br>
The power and passion leaping from its calm,<br>
The rapture of its movement and its rest,<br>
And its fire-sweet miracle of transcendent life,<br>
The million-pointing undivided grasp<br>
Of its vision of one same stupendous All,<br>
Its inexhaustible acts in a timeless Time,<br>
A space that is its own infinity.<br>
A glorious multiple of one radiant Self,<br>
Answering to joy with joy, to love with love,<br>
All there were moving mansions of God-bliss;<br>
Eternal and unique they lived the One.<br>
There forces are great outbursts of God’s truth<br>
And objects are its pure spiritual shapes;<br>
Spirit no more is hid from its own view,<br>
All sentience is a sea of happiness<br>
And all creation is an act of light.<br>
Out of the neutral silence of his soul<br>
He passed to its fields of puissance and of calm<br>
And saw the Powers that stand above the world,<br>
Traversed the realms of the supreme Idea<br>
And sought the summit of created things<br>
And the almighty source of cosmic change.<br>

An equal of the first creator seers,<br>
Accompanied by an all-revealing light<br>
He moved through regions of transcendent Truth<br>
Inward, immense, innumerably one.<br>
There distance was his own huge spirit’s extent;<br>
Delivered from the fictions of the mind<br>
Time’s triple dividing step baffled no more;<br>
Its inevitable and continuous stream,<br>
The long flow of its manifesting course,<br>
Was held in spirit’s single wide regard.<br>
A universal beauty showed its face:<br>
The invisible deep-fraught significances,<br>
Here sheltered behind form’s insensible screen,<br>
Uncovered to him their deathless harmony<br>
And the key to the wonder-book of common things.<br>
In their uniting law stood up revealed<br>
The multiple measures of the upbuilding force,<br>
The lines of the World-Geometer’s technique,<br>
The enchantments that uphold the cosmic web<br>
And the magic underlying simple shapes.<br>
On peaks where Silence listens with still heart<br>
To the rhythmic metres of the rolling worlds,<br>
He served the sessions of the triple Fire.<br>
On the rim of two continents of slumber and trance<br>

Awaken revelation’s mystic cry,<br>
The birthplace found of the sudden infallible Word<br>
And lived in the rays of an intuitive Sun.<br>

Sat voiceless in a vast passivity;<br>
It judged not, measured not, nor strove to know,<br>
But listened for the veiled all-seeing Thought<br>
And the burden of a calm transcendent Voice.<br>
He had reached the top of all that can be known:<br>
His sight surpassed creation’s head and base;<br>
Ablaze the triple heavens revealed their suns,<br>
The obscure Abyss exposed its monstrous rule.<br>
All but the ultimate Mystery was his field,<br>
Almost the Unknowable disclosed its rim.<br>

And burning from the superconscious heights<br>

ALL IS too little that the world can give:<br>
Its power and knowledge are the gifts of Time<br>
And cannot fill the spirit’s sacred thirst.<br>
Although of One these forms of greatness are<br>
And by its breath of grace our lives abide,<br>
Although more near to us than nearness’ self,<br>
It is some utter truth of what we are;<br>
Hidden by its own works, it seemed far-off,<br>
Impenetrable, occult, voiceless, obscure.<br>
The Presence was lost by which all things have charm,<br>
The Glory lacked of which they are dim signs.<br>
The world lived on made empty of its Cause,<br>
Like love when the beloved’s face is gone.<br>
The labour to know seemed a vain strife of Mind;<br>
All knowledge ended in the Unknowable:<br>
The effort to rule seemed a vain pride of Will;<br>
A trivial achievement scorned by Time,<br>
All power retired into the Omnipotent.<br>
A cave of darkness guards the eternal Light.<br>
A silence settled on his striving heart;<br>
Absolved from the voices of the world’s desire,<br>
He turned to the Ineffable’s timeless call.<br>
A Being intimate and unnameable,<br>
A wide compelling ecstasy and peace<br>
Felt in himself and all and yet ungrasped,<br>
Approached and faded from his soul’s pursuit<br>
As if for ever luring him beyond.<br>
Near, it retreated; far, it called him still.<br>

But when the uplifting Deity withdrew,<br>
Existence lost its aim in the Inane.<br>

Were turned to props for an impermanent scene.<br>
But who that mightiness was he knew not yet.<br>

It made and blotted out a million worlds<br>
And took and lost a thousand shapes and names.<br>

Or was a subtle kernel in the soul:<br>
A distant greatness left it huge and dim,<br>
A mystic closeness shut it sweetly in:<br>
It seemed sometimes a figment or a robe<br>
And seemed sometimes his own colossal shade.<br>
A giant doubt overshadowed his advance.<br>
Across a neutral all-supporting Void<br>
Whose blankness nursed his lone immortal spirit,<br>
Allured towards some recondite Supreme,<br>
Aided, coerced by enigmatic Powers,<br>
Aspiring and half-sinking and upborne,<br>
Invincibly he ascended without pause.<br>
Always a signless vague Immensity<br>
Brooded, without approach, beyond response,<br>
Condemning finite things to nothingness,<br>
Fronting him with the incommensurable.<br>
Then to the ascent there came a mighty term.<br>
A height was reached where nothing made could live,<br>
A line where every hope and search must cease<br>
Neared some intolerant bare Reality,<br>
A zero formed pregnant with boundless change.<br>
On a dizzy verge where all disguises fail<br>
And human mind must abdicate in Light<br>
Or die like a moth in the naked blaze of Truth,<br>

Must now be left behind or else transform<br>
Into a self of That which has no name.<br>
Alone and fronting an intangible Force<br>
Which offered nothing to the grasp of Thought,<br>
His spirit faced the adventure of the Inane.<br>
Abandoned by the worlds of Form he strove.<br>
A fruitful world-wide Ignorance foundered here;<br>
Thought’s long far-circling journey touched its close<br>
And ineffective paused the actor Will.<br>
The symbol modes of being helped no more,<br>
The structures Nescience builds collapsing failed,<br>
And even the spirit that holds the universe<br>
Fainted in luminous insufficiency.<br>
In an abysmal lapse of all things built<br>
Transcending every perishable support<br>
And joining at last its mighty origin,<br>
The separate self must melt or be reborn<br>
Into a Truth beyond the mind’s appeal.<br>
All glory of outline, sweetness of harmony,<br>
Rejected like a grace of trivial notes,<br>
Expunged from Being’s silence nude, austere,<br>
Died into a fine and blissful Nothingness.<br>
The Demiurges lost their names and forms,<br>
The great schemed worlds that they had planned and wrought<br>
Passed, taken and abolished one by one.<br>
The universe removed its coloured veil,<br>
And at the unimaginable end<br>
Of the huge riddle of created things<br>
Appeared the far-seen Godhead of the whole,<br>
His feet firm-based on Life’s stupendous wings,<br>
Omnipotent, a lonely seer of Time,<br>
Inward, inscrutable, with diamond gaze.<br>
Attracted by the unfathomable regard<br>
The unsolved slow cycles to their fount returned<br>
To rise again from that invisible sea.<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
All from his puissance born was now undone;<br>
Nothing remained the cosmic Mind conceives.<br>
Eternity prepared to fade and seemed<br>
A hue and imposition on the Void,<br>
Space was the fluttering of a dream that sank<br>
Before its ending into Nothing’s deeps.<br>
The spirit that dies not and the Godhead’s self<br>
Seemed myths projected from the Unknowable;<br>
From It all sprang, in It is called to cease.<br>
But what That was, no thought nor sight could tell.<br>
Only a formless Form of self was left,<br>
A tenuous ghost of something that had been,<br>
The last experience of a lapsing wave<br>
Before it sinks into a bourneless sea, —<br>
As if it kept even on the brink of Nought<br>
Its bare feeling of the ocean whence it came.<br>
A Vastness brooded free from sense of Space,<br>
An Everlastingness cut off from Time;<br>
A strange sublime inalterable Peace<br>
Silent rejected from it world and soul.<br>
A stark companionless Reality<br>
Answered at last to his soul’s passionate search:<br>
Passionless, wordless, absorbed in its fathomless hush,<br>
Keeping the mystery none would ever pierce,<br>
It brooded inscrutable and intangible<br>
Facing him with its dumb tremendous calm.<br>
It had no kinship with the universe:<br>
There was no act, no movement in its Vast:<br>
Life’s question met by its silence died on her lips,<br>
The world’s effort ceased convicted of ignorance<br>
Finding no sanction of supernal Light:<br>
There was no mind there with its need to know,<br>
There was no heart there with its need to love.<br>
All person perished in its namelessness.<br>
There was no second, it had no partner or peer;<br>
Only itself was real to itself.<br>

CANTO I: The Pursuit of the Unknowable<br>
<br>
309<br>
<br>
A pure existence safe from thought and mood,<br>
A consciousness of unshared immortal bliss,<br>
It dwelt aloof in its bare infinite,<br>
One and unique, unutterably sole.<br>
A Being formless, featureless and mute<br>
That knew itself by its own timeless self,<br>
Aware for ever in its motionless depths,<br>
Uncreating, uncreated and unborn,<br>
The One by whom all live, who lives by none,<br>
An immeasurable luminous secrecy<br>
Guarded by the veils of the Unmanifest,<br>
Above the changing cosmic interlude<br>
Abode supreme, immutably the same,<br>
A silent Cause occult, impenetrable, —<br>
Infinite, eternal, unthinkable, alone.<br>
END OF CANTO ONE<br>
<br>
Canto Two<br>
<br>
The Adoration of the Divine Mother<br>
A STILLNESS absolute, incommunicable,<br>
Meets the sheer self-discovery of the soul;<br>
A wall of stillness shuts it from the world,<br>
A gulf of stillness swallows up the sense<br>
And makes unreal all that mind has known,<br>
All that the labouring senses still would weave<br>
Prolonging an imaged unreality.<br>
Self’s vast spiritual silence occupies Space;<br>
Only the Inconceivable is left,<br>
Only the Nameless without space and time:<br>
Abolished is the burdening need of life:<br>
Thought falls from us, we cease from joy and grief;<br>
The ego is dead; we are freed from being and care,<br>
We have done with birth and death and work and fate.<br>
O soul, it is too early to rejoice!<br>
Thou hast reached the boundless silence of the Self,<br>
Thou hast leaped into a glad divine abyss;<br>
But where hast thou thrown Self’s mission and Self’s power?<br>
On what dead bank on the Eternal’s road?<br>
One was within thee who was self and world,<br>
What hast thou done for his purpose in the stars?<br>
Escape brings not the victory and the crown!<br>
Something thou cam’st to do from the Unknown,<br>
But nothing is finished and the world goes on<br>
Because only half God’s cosmic work is done.<br>
Only the everlasting No has neared<br>
And stared into thy eyes and killed thy heart:<br>
But where is the Lover’s everlasting Yes,<br>
And immortality in the secret heart,<br>
The voice that chants to the creator Fire,<br>
The symbolled OM, the great assenting Word,<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Adoration of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
The bridge between the rapture and the calm,<br>
The passion and the beauty of the Bride,<br>
The chamber where the glorious enemies kiss,<br>
The smile that saves, the golden peak of things?<br>
This too is Truth at the mystic fount of Life.<br>
A black veil has been lifted; we have seen<br>
The mighty shadow of the omniscient Lord;<br>
But who has lifted up the veil of light<br>
And who has seen the body of the King?<br>
The mystery of God’s birth and acts remains<br>
Leaving unbroken the last chapter’s seal,<br>
Unsolved the riddle of the unfinished Play;<br>
The cosmic Player laughs within his mask,<br>
And still the last inviolate secret hides<br>
Behind the human glory of a Form,<br>
Behind the gold eidolon of a Name.<br>
A large white line has figured as a goal,<br>
But far beyond the ineffable suntracks blaze:<br>
What seemed the source and end was a wide gate,<br>
A last bare step into eternity.<br>
An eye has opened upon timelessness,<br>
Infinity takes back the forms it gave,<br>
And through God’s darkness or his naked light<br>
His million rays return into the Sun.<br>
There is a zero sign of the Supreme;<br>
Nature left nude and still uncovers God.<br>
But in her grandiose nothingness all is there:<br>
When her strong garbs are torn away from us,<br>
The soul’s ignorance is slain but not the soul:<br>
The zero covers an immortal face.<br>
A high and blank negation is not all,<br>
A huge extinction is not God’s last word,<br>
Life’s ultimate sense, the close of being’s course,<br>
The meaning of this great mysterious world.<br>
In absolute silence sleeps an absolute Power.<br>
Awaking, it can wake the trance-bound soul<br>
<br>
311<br>

BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
And in the ray reveal the parent sun:<br>
It can make the world a vessel of Spirit’s force,<br>
It can fashion in the clay God’s perfect shape.<br>
To free the self is but one radiant pace;<br>
Here to fulfil himself was God’s desire.<br>
Even while he stood on being’s naked edge<br>
And all the passion and seeking of his soul<br>
Faced their extinction in some featureless Vast,<br>
The Presence he yearned for suddenly drew close.<br>
Across the silence of the ultimate Calm,<br>
Out of a marvellous Transcendence’ core,<br>
A body of wonder and translucency<br>
As if a sweet mystic summary of her self<br>
Escaping into the original Bliss<br>
Had come enlarged out of eternity,<br>
Someone came infinite and absolute.<br>
A being of wisdom, power and delight,<br>
Even as a mother draws her child to her arms,<br>
Took to her breast Nature and world and soul.<br>
Abolishing the signless emptiness,<br>
Breaking the vacancy and voiceless hush,<br>
Piercing the limitless Unknowable,<br>
Into the liberty of the motionless depths<br>
A beautiful and felicitous lustre stole.<br>
The Power, the Light, the Bliss no word can speak<br>
Imaged itself in a surprising beam<br>
And built a golden passage to his heart<br>
Touching through him all longing sentient things.<br>
A moment’s sweetness of the All-Beautiful<br>
Cancelled the vanity of the cosmic whirl.<br>
A Nature throbbing with a Heart divine<br>
Was felt in the unconscious universe;<br>
It made the breath a happy mystery.<br>
A love that bore the cross of pain with joy<br>
Eudaemonised the sorrow of the world,<br>
<br>
312<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Adoration of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
Made happy the weight of long unending Time,<br>
The secret caught of God’s felicity.<br>
Affirming in life a hidden ecstasy<br>
It held the spirit to its miraculous course;<br>
Carrying immortal values to the hours<br>
It justified the labour of the suns.<br>
For one was there supreme behind the God.<br>
A Mother Might brooded upon the world;<br>
A Consciousness revealed its marvellous front<br>
Transcending all that is, denying none:<br>
Imperishable above our fallen heads<br>
He felt a rapturous and unstumbling Force.<br>
The undying Truth appeared, the enduring Power<br>
Of all that here is made and then destroyed,<br>
The Mother of all godheads and all strengths<br>
Who, mediatrix, binds earth to the Supreme.<br>
The Enigma ceased that rules our nature’s night,<br>
The covering Nescience was unmasked and slain;<br>
Its mind of error was stripped off from things<br>
And the dull moods of its perverting will.<br>
Illumined by her all-seeing identity<br>
Knowledge and Ignorance could strive no more;<br>
No longer could the titan Opposites,<br>
Antagonist poles of the world’s artifice,<br>
Impose the illusion of their twofold screen<br>
Throwing their figures between us and her.<br>
The Wisdom was near, disguised by its own works,<br>
Of which the darkened universe is the robe.<br>
No more existence seemed an aimless fall,<br>
Extinction was no more the sole release.<br>
The hidden Word was found, the long-sought clue,<br>
Revealed was the meaning of our spirit’s birth,<br>
Condemned to an imperfect body and mind,<br>
In the inconscience of material things<br>
And the indignity of mortal life.<br>
A Heart was felt in the spaces wide and bare,<br>
<br>
313<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
A burning Love from white spiritual founts<br>
Annulled the sorrow of the ignorant depths;<br>
Suffering was lost in her immortal smile.<br>
A Life from beyond grew conqueror here of death;<br>
To err no more was natural to mind;<br>
Wrong could not come where all was light and love.<br>
The Formless and the Formed were joined in her:<br>
Immensity was exceeded by a look,<br>
A Face revealed the crowded Infinite.<br>
Incarnating inexpressibly in her limbs<br>
The boundless joy the blind world-forces seek,<br>
Her body of beauty mooned the seas of bliss.<br>
At the head she stands of birth and toil and fate,<br>
In their slow round the cycles turn to her call;<br>
Alone her hands can change Time’s dragon base.<br>
Hers is the mystery the Night conceals;<br>
The spirit’s alchemist energy is hers;<br>
She is the golden bridge, the wonderful fire.<br>
The luminous heart of the Unknown is she,<br>
A power of silence in the depths of God;<br>
She is the Force, the inevitable Word,<br>
The magnet of our difficult ascent,<br>
The Sun from which we kindle all our suns,<br>
The Light that leans from the unrealised Vasts,<br>
The joy that beckons from the impossible,<br>
The Might of all that never yet came down.<br>
All Nature dumbly calls to her alone<br>
To heal with her feet the aching throb of life<br>
And break the seals on the dim soul of man<br>
And kindle her fire in the closed heart of things.<br>
All here shall be one day her sweetness’ home,<br>
All contraries prepare her harmony;<br>
Towards her our knowledge climbs, our passion gropes;<br>
In her miraculous rapture we shall dwell,<br>
Her clasp shall turn to ecstasy our pain.<br>
Our self shall be one self with all through her.<br>
<br>
314<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Adoration of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
In her confirmed because transformed in her,<br>
Our life shall find in its fulfilled response<br>
Above, the boundless hushed beatitudes,<br>
Below, the wonder of the embrace divine.<br>
This known as in a thunder-flash of God,<br>
The rapture of things eternal filled his limbs;<br>
Amazement fell upon his ravished sense;<br>
His spirit was caught in her intolerant flame.<br>
Once seen, his heart acknowledged only her.<br>
Only a hunger of infinite bliss was left.<br>
All aims in her were lost, then found in her;<br>
His base was gathered to one pointing spire.<br>
This was a seed cast into endless Time.<br>
A Word is spoken or a Light is shown,<br>
A moment sees, the ages toil to express.<br>
So flashing out of the Timeless leaped the worlds;<br>
An eternal instant is the cause of the years.<br>
All he had done was to prepare a field;<br>
His small beginnings asked for a mighty end:<br>
For all that he had been must now new-shape<br>
In him her joy to embody, to enshrine<br>
Her beauty and greatness in his house of life.<br>
But now his being was too wide for self;<br>
His heart’s demand had grown immeasurable:<br>
His single freedom could not satisfy,<br>
Her light, her bliss he asked for earth and men.<br>
But vain are human power and human love<br>
To break earth’s seal of ignorance and death;<br>
His nature’s might seemed now an infant’s grasp;<br>
Heaven is too high for outstretched hands to seize.<br>
This Light comes not by struggle or by thought;<br>
In the mind’s silence the Transcendent acts<br>
And the hushed heart hears the unuttered Word.<br>
A vast surrender was his only strength.<br>
A Power that lives upon the heights must act,<br>
<br>
315<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
316<br>
<br>
Bring into life’s closed room the Immortal’s air<br>
And fill the finite with the Infinite.<br>
All that denies must be torn out and slain<br>
And crushed the many longings for whose sake<br>
We lose the One for whom our lives were made.<br>
Now other claims had hushed in him their cry:<br>
Only he longed to draw her presence and power<br>
Into his heart and mind and breathing frame;<br>
Only he yearned to call for ever down<br>
Her healing touch of love and truth and joy<br>
Into the darkness of the suffering world.<br>
His soul was freed and given to her alone.<br>
END OF CANTO TWO<br>
<br>
Canto Three<br>
<br>
The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
A MIGHTIER task remained than all he had done.<br>
To That he turned from which all being comes,<br>
A sign attending from the Secrecy<br>
Which knows the Truth ungrasped behind our thoughts<br>
And guards the world with its all-seeing gaze.<br>
In the unapproachable stillness of his soul,<br>
Intense, one-pointed, monumental, lone,<br>
Patient he sat like an incarnate hope<br>
Motionless on a pedestal of prayer.<br>
A strength he sought that was not yet on earth,<br>
Help from a Power too great for mortal will,<br>
The light of a Truth now only seen afar,<br>
A sanction from his high omnipotent Source.<br>
But from the appalling heights there stooped no voice;<br>
The timeless lids were closed; no opening came.<br>
A neutral helpless void oppressed the years.<br>
In the texture of our bound humanity<br>
He felt the stark resistance huge and dumb<br>
Of our inconscient and unseeing base,<br>
The stubborn mute rejection in life’s depths,<br>
The ignorant No in the origin of things.<br>
A veiled collaboration with the Night<br>
Even in himself survived and hid from his view:<br>
Still something in his earthly being kept<br>
Its kinship with the Inconscient whence it came.<br>
A shadowy unity with a vanished past<br>
Treasured in an old-world frame was lurking there,<br>
Secret, unnoted by the illumined mind,<br>
And in subconscious whispers and in dream<br>
Still murmured at the mind’s and spirit’s choice.<br>
Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall,<br>
And old ideal voices wandering moaned<br>
And pleaded for a heavenly leniency<br>
To the gracious imperfections of our earth<br>
And the sweet weaknesses of our mortal state.<br>
This now he willed to discover and exile,<br>
The element in him betraying God.<br>
All Nature’s recondite spaces were stripped bare,<br>
All her dim crypts and corners searched with fire<br>
Where refugee instincts and unshaped revolts<br>
Could shelter find in darkness’ sanctuary<br>
Against the white purity of heaven’s cleansing flame.<br>
All seemed to have perished that was undivine:<br>
Yet some minutest dissident might escape<br>
And still a centre lurk of the blind force.<br>
For the Inconscient too is infinite;<br>
The more its abysses we insist to sound,<br>
The more it stretches, stretches endlessly.<br>
Then lest a human cry should spoil the Truth<br>
He tore desire up from its bleeding roots<br>
And offered to the gods the vacant place.<br>
Thus could he bear the touch immaculate.<br>
A last and mightiest transformation came.<br>
His soul was all in front like a great sea<br>
Flooding the mind and body with its waves;<br>
His being, spread to embrace the universe,<br>
United the within and the without<br>
To make of life a cosmic harmony,<br>
An empire of the immanent Divine.<br>
In this tremendous universality<br>
Not only his soul-nature and mind-sense<br>
Included every soul and mind in his,<br>
But even the life of flesh and nerve was changed<br>
And grew one flesh and nerve with all that lives;<br>
He felt the joy of others as his joy,<br>
He bore the grief of others as his grief;<br>
<br>
318<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
<br>
His universal sympathy upbore,<br>
Immense like ocean, the creation’s load<br>
As earth upbears all beings’ sacrifice,<br>
Thrilled with the hidden Transcendent’s joy and peace.<br>
There was no more division’s endless scroll;<br>
One grew the Spirit’s secret unity,<br>
All Nature felt again the single bliss.<br>
There was no cleavage between soul and soul,<br>
There was no barrier between world and God.<br>
Overpowered were form and memory’s limiting line;<br>
The covering mind was seized and torn apart;<br>
It was dissolved and now no more could be,<br>
The one Consciousness that made the world was seen;<br>
All now was luminosity and force.<br>
Abolished in its last thin fainting trace<br>
The circle of the little self was gone;<br>
The separate being could no more be felt;<br>
It disappeared and knew itself no more,<br>
Lost in the spirit’s wide identity.<br>
His nature grew a movement of the All,<br>
Exploring itself to find that all was He,<br>
His soul was a delegation of the All<br>
That turned from itself to join the one Supreme.<br>
Transcended was the human formula;<br>
Man’s heart that had obscured the Inviolable<br>
Assumed the mighty beating of a god’s;<br>
His seeking mind ceased in the Truth that knows;<br>
His life was a flow of the universal life.<br>
He stood fulfilled on the world’s highest line<br>
Awaiting the ascent beyond the world,<br>
Awaiting the descent the world to save.<br>
A Splendour and a Symbol wrapped the earth,<br>
Serene epiphanies looked and hallowed vasts<br>
Surrounded, wise infinitudes were close<br>
And bright remotenesses leaned near and kin.<br>
Sense failed in that tremendous lucency;<br>
<br>
319<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
Ephemeral voices from his hearing fell<br>
And Thought potent no more sank large and pale<br>
Like a tired god into mysterious seas.<br>
The robes of mortal thinking were cast down<br>
Leaving his knowledge bare to absolute sight;<br>
Fate’s driving ceased and Nature’s sleepless spur:<br>
The athlete heavings of the will were stilled<br>
In the Omnipotent’s unmoving peace.<br>
Life in his members lay down vast and mute;<br>
Naked, unwalled, unterrified it bore<br>
The immense regard of Immortality.<br>
The last movement died and all at once grew still.<br>
A weight that was the unseen Transcendent’s hand<br>
Laid on his limbs the Spirit’s measureless seal,<br>
Infinity swallowed him into shoreless trance.<br>
As one who sets his sail towards mysteried shores<br>
Driven through huge oceans by the breath of God,<br>
The fathomless below, the unknown around,<br>
His soul abandoned the blind star-field, Space.<br>
Afar from all that makes the measured world,<br>
Plunging to hidden eternities it withdrew<br>
Back from mind’s foaming surface to the Vasts<br>
Voiceless within us in omniscient sleep.<br>
Above the imperfect reach of word and thought,<br>
Beyond the sight that seeks support of form,<br>
Lost in deep tracts of superconscient Light,<br>
Or voyaging in blank featureless Nothingness,<br>
Sole in the trackless Incommensurable,<br>
Or past not-self and self and selflessness,<br>
Transgressing the dream-shores of conscious mind<br>
He reached at last his sempiternal base.<br>
On sorrowless heights no winging cry disturbs,<br>
Pure and untouched above this mortal play<br>
Is spread the spirit’s hushed immobile air.<br>
There no beginning is and there no end;<br>
<br>
320<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
<br>
There is the stable force of all that moves;<br>
There the aeonic labourer is at rest.<br>
There turns no keyed creation in the void,<br>
No giant mechanism watched by a soul;<br>
There creaks no fate-turned huge machinery;<br>
The marriage of evil with good within one breast,<br>
The clash of strife in the very clasp of love,<br>
The dangerous pain of life’s experiment<br>
In the values of Inconsequence and Chance,<br>
The peril of mind’s gamble, throwing our lives<br>
As stake in a wager of indifferent gods<br>
And the shifting lights and shadows of the idea<br>
Falling upon the surface consciousness,<br>
And in the dream of a mute witness soul<br>
Creating the error of a half-seen world<br>
Where knowledge is a seeking ignorance,<br>
Life’s steps a stumbling series without suit,<br>
Its aspect of fortuitous design,<br>
Its equal measure of the true and false<br>
In that immobile and immutable realm<br>
Find no access, no cause, no right to live:<br>
There only reigns the spirit’s motionless power<br>
Poised in itself through still eternity<br>
And its omniscient and omnipotent peace.<br>
Thought clashes not with thought and truth with truth,<br>
There is no war of right with rival right;<br>
There are no stumbling and half-seeing lives<br>
Passing from chance to unexpected chance,<br>
No suffering of hearts compelled to beat<br>
In bodies of the inert Inconscient’s make.<br>
Armed with the immune occult unsinking Fire<br>
The guardians of Eternity keep its law<br>
For ever fixed upon Truth’s giant base<br>
In her magnificent and termless home.<br>
There Nature on her dumb spiritual couch<br>
Immutably transcendent knows her source<br>
<br>
321<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
And to the stir of multitudinous worlds<br>
Assents unmoved in a perpetual calm.<br>
All-causing, all-sustaining and aloof,<br>
The Witness looks from his unshaken poise,<br>
An Eye immense regarding all things done.<br>
Apart, at peace above creation’s stir,<br>
Immersed in the eternal altitudes,<br>
He abode defended in his shoreless self,<br>
Companioned only by the all-seeing One.<br>
A Mind too mighty to be bound by Thought,<br>
A Life too boundless for the play in Space,<br>
A Soul without borders unconvinced of Time,<br>
He felt the extinction of the world’s long pain,<br>
He became the unborn Self that never dies,<br>
He joined the sessions of Infinity.<br>
On the cosmic murmur primal loneliness fell,<br>
Annulled was the contact formed with time-born things,<br>
Empty grew Nature’s wide community.<br>
All things were brought back to their formless seed,<br>
The world was silent for a cyclic hour.<br>
Although the afflicted Nature he had left<br>
Maintained beneath him her broad numberless fields,<br>
Her enormous act, receding, failed remote<br>
As if a soulless dream at last had ceased.<br>
No voice came down from the high Silences,<br>
None answered from her desolate solitudes.<br>
A stillness of cessation reigned, the wide<br>
Immortal hush before the gods are born;<br>
A universal Force awaited, mute,<br>
The veiled Transcendent’s ultimate decree.<br>
Then suddenly there came a downward look.<br>
As if a sea exploring its own depths,<br>
A living Oneness widened at its core<br>
And joined him to unnumbered multitudes.<br>
A Bliss, a Light, a Power, a flame-white Love<br>
<br>
322<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
<br>
Caught all into a sole immense embrace;<br>
Existence found its truth on Oneness’ breast<br>
And each became the self and space of all.<br>
The great world-rhythms were heart-beats of one Soul,<br>
To feel was a flame-discovery of God,<br>
All mind was a single harp of many strings,<br>
All life a song of many meeting lives;<br>
For worlds were many, but the Self was one.<br>
This knowledge now was made a cosmos’ seed:<br>
This seed was cased in the safety of the Light,<br>
It needed not a sheath of Ignorance.<br>
Then from the trance of that tremendous clasp<br>
And from the throbbings of that single Heart<br>
And from the naked Spirit’s victory<br>
A new and marvellous creation rose.<br>
Incalculable outflowing infinitudes<br>
Laughing out an unmeasured happiness<br>
Lived their innumerable unity;<br>
Worlds where the being is unbound and wide<br>
Bodied unthinkably the egoless Self;<br>
Rapture of beatific energies<br>
Joined Time to the Timeless, poles of a single joy;<br>
White vasts were seen where all is wrapped in all.<br>
There were no contraries, no sundered parts,<br>
All by spiritual links were joined to all<br>
And bound indissolubly to the One:<br>
Each was unique, but took all lives as his own,<br>
And, following out these tones of the Infinite,<br>
Recognised in himself the universe.<br>
A splendid centre of infinity’s whirl<br>
Pushed to its zenith’s height, its last expanse,<br>
Felt the divinity of its own self-bliss<br>
Repeated in its numberless other selves:<br>
It took up tirelessly into its scope<br>
Persons and figures of the Impersonal,<br>
As if prolonging in a ceaseless count,<br>

None was apart, none lived for himself alone,<br>
Each lived for God in him and God in all,<br>
Each soleness inexpressibly held the whole.<br>
There Oneness was not tied to monotone;<br>
It showed a thousand aspects of itself,<br>
Its calm immutable stability<br>
Upbore on a changeless ground for ever safe,<br>
Compelled to a spontaneous servitude,<br>
The ever-changing incalculable steps,<br>
The seeming-reckless dance’s subtle plan<br>
Of immense world-forces in their perfect play.<br>
Appearance looked back to its hidden truth<br>
And made of difference oneness’ smiling play;<br>
It made all persons fractions of the Unique,<br>
Yet all were being’s secret integers.<br>
All struggle was turned to a sweet strife of love<br>
In the harmonised circle of a sure embrace.<br>
Identity’s reconciling happiness gave<br>
A rich security to difference.<br>
On a meeting line of hazardous extremes<br>
The game of games was played to its breaking-point,<br>
Where through self-finding by divine self-loss<br>
There leaps out unity’s supreme delight<br>
Whose blissful undivided sweetness feels<br>
A communality of the Absolute.<br>
There was no sob of suffering anywhere;<br>
Experience ran from point to point of joy:<br>
Bliss was the pure undying truth of things.<br>
All Nature was a conscious front of God:<br>
A wisdom worked in all, self-moved, self-sure,<br>
A plenitude of illimitable Light,<br>
An authenticity of intuitive Truth,<br>
A glory and passion of creative Force.<br>
Infallible, leaping from eternity,<br>

<br>
The moment’s thought inspired the passing act.<br>
A word, a laughter, sprang from Silence’ breast,<br>
A rhythm of Beauty in the calm of Space,<br>
A knowledge in the fathomless heart of Time.<br>
All turned to all without reserve’s recoil:<br>
A single ecstasy without a break,<br>
Love was a close and thrilled identity<br>
In the throbbing heart of all that luminous life.<br>
A universal vision that unites,<br>
A sympathy of nerve replying to nerve,<br>
Hearing that listens to thought’s inner sound<br>
And follows the rhythmic meanings of the heart,<br>
A touch that needs not hands to feel, to clasp,<br>
Were there the native means of consciousness<br>
And heightened the intimacy of soul with soul.<br>
A grand orchestra of spiritual powers,<br>
A diapason of soul-interchange<br>
Harmonised a Oneness deep, immeasurable.<br>
In these new worlds projected he became<br>
A portion of the universal gaze,<br>
A station of the all-inhabiting light,<br>
A ripple on a single sea of peace.<br>
His mind answered to countless communing minds,<br>
His words were syllables of the cosmos’ speech,<br>
His life a field of the vast cosmic stir.<br>
He felt the footsteps of a million wills<br>
Moving in unison to a single goal.<br>
A stream ever new-born that never dies,<br>
Caught in its thousandfold current’s ravishing flow,<br>
With eddies of immortal sweetness thrilled,<br>
He bore coiling through his members as they passed<br>
Calm movements of interminable delight,<br>
The bliss of a myriad myriads who are one.<br>
In this vast outbreak of perfection’s law<br>
Imposing its fixity on the flux of things<br>

He saw a hierarchy of lucent planes<br>
Enfeoffed to this highest kingdom of God-state.<br>
Attuning to one Truth their own right rule<br>
Each housed the gladness of a bright degree,<br>
Alone in beauty, perfect in self-kind,<br>
An image cast by one deep truth’s absolute,<br>
Married to all in happy difference.<br>
Each gave its powers to help its neighbours’ parts,<br>
But suffered no diminution by the gift;<br>
Profiteers of a mystic interchange,<br>
They grew by what they took and what they gave,<br>
All others they felt as their own complements,<br>
One in the might and joy of multitude.<br>
Even in the poise where Oneness draws apart<br>
To feel the rapture of its separate selves,<br>
The Sole in its solitude yearned towards the All<br>
And the Many turned to look back at the One.<br>
An all-revealing all-creating Bliss,<br>
Seeking for forms to manifest truths divine,<br>
Aligned in their significant mystery<br>
The gleams of the symbols of the Ineffable<br>
Blazoned like hues upon a colourless air<br>
On the white purity of the Witness Soul.<br>
These hues were the very prism of the Supreme,<br>
His beauty, power, delight creation’s cause.<br>
A vast Truth-Consciousness took up these signs<br>
To pass them on to some divine child Heart<br>
That looked on them with laughter and delight<br>
And joyed in these transcendent images<br>
Living and real as the truths they house.<br>
The Spirit’s white neutrality became<br>
A playground of miracles, a rendezvous<br>
For the secret powers of a mystic Timelessness:<br>
It made of Space a marvel house of God,<br>
It poured through Time its works of ageless might,<br>
Unveiled seen as a luring rapturous face<br>

The wonder and beauty of its Love and Force.<br>
The eternal Goddess moved in her cosmic house<br>
Sporting with God as a Mother with her child:<br>
To him the universe was her bosom of love,<br>
His toys were the immortal verities.<br>
All here self-lost had there its divine place.<br>
The Powers that here betray our hearts and err,<br>
Were there sovereign in truth, perfect in joy,<br>
Masters in a creation without flaw,<br>
Possessors of their own infinitude.<br>
There Mind, a splendid sun of vision’s rays,<br>
Shaped substance by the glory of its thoughts<br>
And moved amidst the grandeur of its dreams.<br>
Imagination’s great ensorcelling rod<br>
Summoned the unknown and gave to it a home,<br>
Outspread luxuriantly in golden air<br>
Truth’s iris-coloured wings of fantasy,<br>
Or sang to the intuitive heart of joy<br>
Wonder’s dream-notes that bring the Real close.<br>
Its power that makes the unknowable near and true,<br>
In the temple of the ideal shrined the One:<br>
It peopled thought and mind and happy sense<br>
Filled with bright aspects of the might of God<br>
And living persons of the one Supreme,<br>
The speech that voices the ineffable,<br>
The ray revealing unseen Presences,<br>
The virgin forms through which the Formless shines,<br>
The Word that ushers divine experience<br>
And the Ideas that crowd the Infinite.<br>
There was no gulf between the thought and fact,<br>
Ever they replied like bird to calling bird;<br>
The will obeyed the thought, the act the will.<br>
There was a harmony woven twixt soul and soul.<br>
A marriage with eternity divinised Time.<br>
There Life pursued, unwearied of her sport,<br>
Joy in her heart and laughter on her lips,<br>

The bright adventure of God’s game of chance.<br>
In her ingenious ardour of caprice,<br>
In her transfiguring mirth she mapped on Time<br>
A fascinating puzzle of events,<br>
Lured at each turn by new vicissitudes<br>
To self-discovery that could never cease.<br>
Ever she framed stark bonds for the will to break,<br>
Brought new creations for the thought’s surprise<br>
And passionate ventures for the heart to dare,<br>
Where Truth recurred with an unexpected face<br>
Or else repeated old familiar joy<br>
Like the return of a delightful rhyme.<br>
At hide-and-seek on a Mother-Wisdom’s breast,<br>
An artist teeming with her world-idea,<br>
She never could exhaust its numberless thoughts<br>
And vast adventure into thinking shapes<br>
And trial and lure of a new living’s dreams.<br>
Untired of sameness and untired of change,<br>
Endlessly she unrolled her moving act,<br>
A mystery drama of divine delight,<br>
A living poem of world-ecstasy,<br>
A kakemono of significant forms,<br>
A coiled perspective of developing scenes,<br>
A brilliant chase of self-revealing shapes,<br>
An ardent hunt of soul looking for soul,<br>
A seeking and a finding as of gods.<br>
There Matter is the Spirit’s firm density,<br>
An artistry of glad outwardness of self,<br>
A treasure-house of lasting images<br>
Where sense can build a world of pure delight:<br>
The home of a perpetual happiness,<br>
It lodged the hours as in a pleasant inn.<br>
The senses there were outlets of the soul;<br>
Even the youngest child-thought of the mind<br>
Incarnated some touch of highest things.<br>
There substance was a resonant harp of self,<br>
<br>

CANTO III: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
<br>
A net for the constant lightnings of the spirit,<br>
A magnet power of love’s intensity<br>
Whose yearning throb and adoration’s cry<br>
Drew God’s approaches close, sweet, wonderful.<br>
Its solidity was a mass of heavenly make;<br>
Its fixity and sweet permanence of charm<br>
Made a bright pedestal for felicity.<br>
Its bodies woven by a divine sense<br>
Prolonged the nearness of soul’s clasp with soul;<br>
Its warm play of external sight and touch<br>
Reflected the glow and thrill of the heart’s joy,<br>
Mind’s climbing brilliant thoughts, the spirit’s bliss;<br>
Life’s rapture kept for ever its flame and cry.<br>
All that now passes lived immortal there<br>
In the proud beauty and fine harmony<br>
Of Matter plastic to spiritual light.<br>
Its ordered hours proclaimed the eternal Law;<br>
Vision reposed on a safety of deathless forms;<br>
Time was Eternity’s transparent robe.<br>
An architect hewing out self’s living rock,<br>
Phenomenon built Reality’s summer-house<br>
On the beaches of the sea of Infinity.<br>
Against this glory of spiritual states,<br>
Their parallels and yet their opposites,<br>
Floated and swayed, eclipsed and shadowlike<br>
As if a doubt made substance, flickering, pale,<br>
This other scheme two vast negations found.<br>
A world that knows not its inhabiting Self<br>
Labours to find its cause and need to be;<br>
A spirit ignorant of the world it made,<br>
Obscured by Matter, travestied by Life,<br>
Struggles to emerge, to be free, to know and reign;<br>
These were close-tied in one disharmony,<br>
Yet the divergent lines met not at all.<br>
Three Powers governed its irrational course,<br>

<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
In the beginning an unknowing Force,<br>
In the middle an embodied striving soul,<br>
In its end a silent spirit denying life.<br>
A dull and infelicitous interlude<br>
Unrolls its dubious truth to a questioning Mind<br>
Compelled by the ignorant Power to play its part<br>
And to record her inconclusive tale,<br>
The mystery of her inconscient plan<br>
And the riddle of a being born from Night<br>
By a marriage of Necessity with Chance.<br>
This darkness hides our nobler destiny.<br>
A chrysalis of a great and glorious truth,<br>
It stifles the winged marvel in its sheath<br>
Lest from the prison of Matter it escape<br>
And, wasting its beauty on the formless Vast,<br>
Merged into the Unknowable’s mystery,<br>
Leave unfulfilled the world’s miraculous fate.<br>
As yet thought only some high spirit’s dream<br>
Or a vexed illusion in man’s toiling mind,<br>
A new creation from the old shall rise,<br>
A Knowledge inarticulate find speech,<br>
Beauty suppressed burst into paradise bloom,<br>
Pleasure and pain dive into absolute bliss.<br>
A tongueless oracle shall speak at last,<br>
The Superconscient conscious grow on earth,<br>
The Eternal’s wonders join the dance of Time.<br>
But now all seemed a vainly teeming vast<br>
Upheld by a deluded Energy<br>
To a spectator self-absorbed and mute,<br>
Careless of the unmeaning show he watched,<br>
Regarding the bizarre procession pass<br>
Like one who waits for an expected end.<br>
He saw a world that is from a world to be.<br>
There he divined rather than saw or felt,<br>
Far off upon the rim of consciousness,<br>
Transient and frail this little whirling globe<br>

CANTO III: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation<br>
<br>
And on it left like a lost dream’s vain mould,<br>
A fragile copy of the spirit’s shell,<br>
His body gathered into mystic sleep.<br>
A foreign shape it seemed, a mythic shade.<br>
Alien now seemed that dim far universe,<br>
Self and eternity alone were true.<br>
Then memory climbed to him from the striving planes<br>
Bringing a cry from once-loved cherished things,<br>
And to the cry as to its own lost call<br>
A ray replied from the occult Supreme.<br>
For even there the boundless Oneness dwells.<br>
To its own sight unrecognisable,<br>
It lived still sunk in its own tenebrous seas,<br>
Upholding the world’s inconscient unity<br>
Hidden in Matter’s insentient multitude.<br>
This seed-self sown in the Indeterminate<br>
Forfeits its glory of divinity,<br>
Concealing the omnipotence of its Force,<br>
Concealing the omniscience of its Soul;<br>
An agent of its own transcendent Will,<br>
It merges knowledge in the inconscient deep;<br>
Accepting error, sorrow, death and pain,<br>
It pays the ransom of the ignorant Night,<br>
Redeeming by its substance Nature’s fall.<br>
Himself he knew and why his soul had gone<br>
Into earth’s passionate obscurity<br>
To share the labour of an errant Power<br>
Which by division hopes to find the One.<br>
Two beings he was, one wide and free above,<br>
One struggling, bound, intense, its portion here.<br>
A tie between them still could bridge two worlds;<br>
There was a dim response, a distant breath;<br>
All had not ceased in the unbounded hush.<br>
His heart lay somewhere conscious and alone<br>
Far down below him like a lamp in night;<br>

Abandoned it lay, alone, imperishable,<br>
Immobile with excess of passionate will,<br>
His living, sacrificed and offered heart<br>
Absorbed in adoration mystical,<br>
Turned to its far-off fount of light and love.<br>
In the luminous stillness of its mute appeal<br>
It looked up to the heights it could not see;<br>
It yearned from the longing depths it could not leave.<br>
In the centre of his vast and fateful trance<br>
Half-way between his free and fallen selves,<br>
Interceding twixt God’s day and the mortal’s night,<br>
Accepting worship as its single law,<br>
Accepting bliss as the sole cause of things,<br>
Refusing the austere joy which none can share,<br>
Refusing the calm that lives for calm alone,<br>
To her it turned for whom it willed to be.<br>
In the passion of its solitary dream<br>
It lay like a closed soundless oratory<br>
Where sleeps a consecrated argent floor<br>
Lit by a single and untrembling ray<br>
And an invisible Presence kneels in prayer.<br>
On some deep breast of liberating peace<br>
All else was satisfied with quietude;<br>
This only knew there was a truth beyond.<br>
All other parts were dumb in centred sleep<br>
Consenting to the slow deliberate Power<br>
Which tolerates the world’s error and its grief,<br>
Consenting to the cosmic long delay,<br>
Timelessly waiting through the patient years<br>
Her coming they had asked for earth and men;<br>
This was the fiery point that called her now.<br>
Extinction could not quench that lonely fire;<br>
Its seeing filled the blank of mind and will;<br>
Thought dead, its changeless force abode and grew.<br>
Armed with the intuition of a bliss<br>
To which some moved tranquillity was the key,<br>

It persevered through life’s huge emptiness<br>
Amid the blank denials of the world.<br>
It sent its voiceless prayer to the Unknown;<br>
It listened for the footsteps of its hopes<br>
Returning through the void immensities,<br>
It waited for the fiat of the Word<br>
That comes through the still self from the Supreme.<br>

Amid the lifeless silence of the Void<br>
In a solitude and an immensity<br>
A sound came quivering like a loved footfall<br>
Heard in the listening spaces of the soul;<br>
A touch perturbed his fibres with delight.<br>
An Influence had approached the mortal range,<br>
A boundless Heart was near his longing heart,<br>
A mystic Form enveloped his earthly shape.<br>
All at her contact broke from silence’ seal;<br>
Spirit and body thrilled identified,<br>
Linked in the grasp of an unspoken joy;<br>
Mind, members, life were merged in ecstasy.<br>
Intoxicated as with nectarous rain<br>
His nature’s passioning stretches flowed to her,<br>
Flashing with lightnings, mad with luminous wine.<br>
All was a limitless sea that heaved to the moon.<br>
A divinising stream possessed his veins,<br>
His body’s cells awoke to spirit sense,<br>
Each nerve became a burning thread of joy:<br>
Tissue and flesh partook beatitude.<br>
Alight, the dun unplumbed subconscient caves<br>
Thrilled with the prescience of her longed-for tread<br>
And filled with flickering crests and praying tongues.<br>
Even lost in slumber, mute, inanimate<br>
His very body answered to her power.<br>
The One he worshipped was within him now:<br>
Flame-pure, ethereal-tressed, a mighty Face<br>
Appeared and lips moved by immortal words;<br>
Lids, Wisdom’s leaves, drooped over rapture’s orbs.<br>
A marble monument of ponderings, shone<br>

CANTO IV: The Vision and the Boon<br>
<br>
A forehead, sight’s crypt, and large like ocean’s gaze<br>
Towards Heaven, two tranquil eyes of boundless thought<br>
Looked into man’s and saw the god to come.<br>
A Shape was seen on threshold Mind, a Voice<br>
Absolute and wise in the heart’s chambers spoke:<br>
“O Son of Strength who climbst creation’s peaks,<br>
No soul is thy companion in the light;<br>
Alone thou standest at the eternal doors.<br>
What thou hast won is thine, but ask no more.<br>
O Spirit aspiring in an ignorant frame,<br>
O Voice arisen from the Inconscient’s world,<br>
How shalt thou speak for men whose hearts are dumb,<br>
Make purblind earth the soul’s seer-vision’s home<br>
Or lighten the burden of the senseless globe?<br>
I am the Mystery beyond reach of mind,<br>
I am the goal of the travail of the suns;<br>
My fire and sweetness are the cause of life.<br>
But too immense my danger and my joy.<br>
Awake not the immeasurable descent,<br>
Speak not my secret name to hostile Time;<br>
Man is too weak to bear the Infinite’s weight.<br>
Truth born too soon might break the imperfect earth.<br>
Leave the all-seeing Power to hew its way:<br>
In thy single vast achievement reign apart<br>
Helping the world with thy great lonely days.<br>
I ask thee not to merge thy heart of flame<br>
In the Immobile’s wide uncaring bliss,<br>
Turned from the fruitless motion of the years,<br>
Deserting the fierce labour of the worlds,<br>
Aloof from beings, lost in the Alone.<br>
How shall thy mighty spirit brook repose<br>
While Death is still unconquered on the earth<br>
And Time a field of suffering and pain?<br>
Thy soul was born to share the laden Force;<br>
Obey thy nature and fulfil thy fate:<br>
Accept the difficulty and godlike toil,<br>

A riddle of opposites is made his field:<br>
Freedom he asks but needs to live in bonds,<br>
He has need of darkness to perceive some light<br>
And need of grief to feel a little bliss;<br>
He has need of death to find a greater life.<br>
All sides he sees and turns to every call;<br>
He has no certain light by which to walk;<br>

He seeks himself and from himself he runs;<br>
Meeting himself, he thinks it other than he.<br>
Always he builds, but finds no constant ground,<br>
Always he journeys, but nowhere arrives;<br>
He would guide the world, himself he cannot guide;<br>
He would save his soul, his life he cannot save.<br>
The light his soul had brought his mind has lost;<br>
All he has learned is soon again in doubt;<br>

Helped by the reason’s vacillating fires,<br>
To make his thought and will a magic door<br>
For knowledge to enter the darkness of the world<br>
And love to rule a realm of strife and hate.<br>

Even when a glory of wisdom crowns his brow,<br>
When mind and spirit shed a grandiose ray<br>
To exalt this product of the sperm and gene,<br>

Drawn endlessly an inconclusive game.<br>
In an ill-fitting and voluminous robe<br>
A radiant purpose still conceals its face,<br>
A mighty blindness stumbles hoping on,<br>

Because the human instrument has failed,<br>

And how shall the end be vain when God is guide?<br>
However man’s mind may tire or fail his flesh,<br>

The goal recedes, a bourneless vastness calls<br>
Retreating into an immense Unknown;<br>
There is no end to the world’s stupendous march,<br>
There is no rest for the embodied soul.<br>

And immortality and spirit-room<br>
And pure perfection and a shadowless bliss<br>
Are this afflicted creature’s mighty fate.<br>
In him the Earth-Mother sees draw near the change<br>
Foreshadowed in her dumb and fiery depths,<br>
A godhead drawn from her transmuted limbs,<br>
An alchemy of Heaven on Nature’s base.<br>
Adept of the self-born unfailing line,<br>
Leave not the light to die the ages bore,<br>
Help still humanity’s blind and suffering life:<br>
Obey thy spirit’s wide omnipotent urge.<br>
A witness to God’s parley with the Night,<br>
It leaned compassionate from immortal calm<br>
And housed desire, the troubled seed of things.<br>
Assent to thy high self, create, endure.<br>
Cease not from knowledge, let thy toil be vast.<br>
No more can earthly limits pen thy force;<br>
Equal thy work with long unending Time’s.<br>
Traveller upon the bare eternal heights,<br>
<br>

CANTO IV: The Vision and the Boon<br>
<br>
Tread still the difficult and dateless path<br>
Joining the cycles with its austere curve<br>
Measured for man by the initiate Gods.<br>
My light shall be in thee, my strength thy force.<br>
Let not the impatient Titan drive thy heart,<br>
Ask not the imperfect fruit, the partial prize.<br>
Only one boon, to greaten thy spirit, demand;<br>
Only one joy, to raise thy kind, desire.<br>
Above blind fate and the antagonist powers<br>
Moveless there stands a high unchanging Will;<br>
To its omnipotence leave thy work’s result.<br>
All things shall change in God’s transfiguring hour.”<br>
August and sweet sank hushed that mighty Voice.<br>
Nothing now moved in the vast brooding space:<br>
A stillness came upon the listening world,<br>
A mute immensity of the Eternal’s peace.<br>
But Aswapati’s heart replied to her,<br>
A cry amid the silence of the Vasts:<br>
“How shall I rest content with mortal days<br>
And the dull measure of terrestrial things,<br>
I who have seen behind the cosmic mask<br>
The glory and the beauty of thy face?<br>
Hard is the doom to which thou bindst thy sons!<br>
How long shall our spirits battle with the Night<br>
And bear defeat and the brute yoke of Death,<br>
We who are vessels of a deathless Force<br>
And builders of the godhead of the race?<br>
Or if it is thy work I do below<br>
Amid the error and waste of human life<br>
In the vague light of man’s half-conscious mind,<br>
Why breaks not in some distant gleam of thee?<br>
Ever the centuries and millenniums pass.<br>
Where in the greyness is thy coming’s ray?<br>
Where is the thunder of thy victory’s wings?<br>
Only we hear the feet of passing gods.<br>

BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
A plan in the occult eternal Mind<br>
Mapped out to backward and prophetic sight,<br>
The aeons ever repeat their changeless round,<br>
The cycles all rebuild and ever aspire.<br>
All we have done is ever still to do.<br>
All breaks and all renews and is the same.<br>
Huge revolutions of life’s fruitless gyre,<br>
The new-born ages perish like the old,<br>
As if the sad Enigma kept its right<br>
Till all is done for which this scene was made.<br>
Too little the strength that now with us is born,<br>
Too faint the light that steals through Nature’s lids,<br>
Too scant the joy with which she buys our pain.<br>
In a brute world that knows not its own sense,<br>
Thought-racked upon the wheel of birth we live,<br>
The instruments of an impulse not our own<br>
Moved to achieve with our heart’s blood for price<br>
Half-knowledge, half-creations that soon tire.<br>
A foiled immortal soul in perishing limbs,<br>
Baffled and beaten back we labour still;<br>
Annulled, frustrated, spent, we still survive.<br>
In anguish we labour that from us may rise<br>
A larger-seeing man with nobler heart,<br>
A golden vessel of the incarnate Truth,<br>
The executor of the divine attempt<br>
Equipped to wear the earthly body of God,<br>
Communicant and prophet and lover and king.<br>
I know that thy creation cannot fail:<br>
For even through the mists of mortal thought<br>
Infallible are thy mysterious steps,<br>
And, though Necessity dons the garb of Chance,<br>
Hidden in the blind shifts of Fate she keeps<br>
The slow calm logic of Infinity’s pace<br>
And the inviolate sequence of its will.<br>
All life is fixed in an ascending scale<br>
And adamantine is the evolving Law;<br>
<br>

<br>
In the beginning is prepared the close.<br>
This strange irrational product of the mire,<br>
This compromise between the beast and god,<br>
Is not the crown of thy miraculous world.<br>
I know there shall inform the inconscient cells,<br>
At one with Nature and at height with heaven,<br>
A spirit vast as the containing sky<br>
And swept with ecstasy from invisible founts,<br>
A god come down and greater by the fall.<br>
A Power arose out of my slumber’s cell.<br>
Abandoning the tardy limp of the hours<br>
And the inconstant blink of mortal sight,<br>
There where the Thinker sleeps in too much light<br>
And intolerant flames the lone all-witnessing Eye<br>
Hearing the word of Fate from Silence’ heart<br>
In the endless moment of Eternity,<br>
It saw from timelessness the works of Time.<br>
Overpassed were the leaden formulas of the Mind,<br>
Overpowered the obstacle of mortal Space:<br>
The unfolding Image showed the things to come.<br>
A giant dance of Shiva tore the past;<br>
There was a thunder as of worlds that fall;<br>
Earth was o’errun with fire and the roar of Death<br>
Clamouring to slay a world his hunger had made;<br>
There was a clangour of Destruction’s wings:<br>
The Titan’s battle-cry was in my ears,<br>
Alarm and rumour shook the armoured Night.<br>
I saw the Omnipotent’s flaming pioneers<br>
Over the heavenly verge which turns towards life<br>
Come crowding down the amber stairs of birth;<br>
Forerunners of a divine multitude,<br>
Out of the paths of the morning star they came<br>
Into the little room of mortal life.<br>
I saw them cross the twilight of an age,<br>
The sun-eyed children of a marvellous dawn,<br>
The great creators with wide brows of calm,<br>

<br>
The massive barrier-breakers of the world<br>
And wrestlers with destiny in her lists of will,<br>
The labourers in the quarries of the gods,<br>
The messengers of the Incommunicable,<br>
The architects of immortality.<br>
Into the fallen human sphere they came,<br>
Faces that wore the Immortal’s glory still,<br>
Voices that communed still with the thoughts of God,<br>
Bodies made beautiful by the spirit’s light,<br>
Carrying the magic word, the mystic fire,<br>
Carrying the Dionysian cup of joy,<br>
Approaching eyes of a diviner man,<br>
Lips chanting an unknown anthem of the soul,<br>
Feet echoing in the corridors of Time.<br>
High priests of wisdom, sweetness, might and bliss,<br>
Discoverers of beauty’s sunlit ways<br>
And swimmers of Love’s laughing fiery floods<br>
And dancers within rapture’s golden doors,<br>
Their tread one day shall change the suffering earth<br>
And justify the light on Nature’s face.<br>
Although Fate lingers in the high Beyond<br>
And the work seems vain on which our heart’s force was spent,<br>
All shall be done for which our pain was borne.<br>
Even as of old man came behind the beast<br>
This high divine successor surely shall come<br>
Behind man’s inefficient mortal pace,<br>
Behind his vain labour, sweat and blood and tears:<br>
He shall know what mortal mind barely durst think,<br>
He shall do what the heart of the mortal could not dare.<br>
Inheritor of the toil of human time,<br>
He shall take on him the burden of the gods;<br>
All heavenly light shall visit the earth’s thoughts,<br>
The might of heaven shall fortify earthly hearts;<br>
Earth’s deeds shall touch the superhuman’s height,<br>
Earth’s seeing widen into the infinite.<br>
Heavy unchanged weighs still the imperfect world;<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Vision and the Boon<br>
<br>
The splendid youth of Time has passed and failed;<br>
Heavy and long are the years our labour counts<br>
And still the seals are firm upon man’s soul<br>
And weary is the ancient Mother’s heart.<br>
O Truth defended in thy secret sun,<br>
Voice of her mighty musings in shut heavens<br>
On things withdrawn within her luminous depths,<br>
O Wisdom-Splendour, Mother of the universe,<br>
Creatrix, the Eternal’s artist Bride,<br>
Linger not long with thy transmuting hand<br>
Pressed vainly on one golden bar of Time,<br>
As if Time dare not open its heart to God.<br>
O radiant fountain of the world’s delight<br>
World-free and unattainable above,<br>
O Bliss who ever dwellst deep-hid within<br>
While men seek thee outside and never find,<br>
Mystery and Muse with hieratic tongue,<br>
Incarnate the white passion of thy force,<br>
Mission to earth some living form of thee.<br>
One moment fill with thy eternity,<br>
Let thy infinity in one body live,<br>
All-Knowledge wrap one mind in seas of light,<br>
All-Love throb single in one human heart.<br>
Immortal, treading the earth with mortal feet<br>
All heaven’s beauty crowd in earthly limbs!<br>
Omnipotence, girdle with the power of God<br>
Movements and moments of a mortal will,<br>
Pack with the eternal might one human hour<br>
And with one gesture change all future time.<br>
Let a great word be spoken from the heights<br>
And one great act unlock the doors of Fate.”<br>
His prayer sank down in the resisting Night<br>
Oppressed by the thousand forces that deny,<br>
As if too weak to climb to the Supreme.<br>
But there arose a wide consenting Voice;<br>
<br>
345<br>
<br>
BOOK III: The Book of the Divine Mother<br>
<br>
The spirit of beauty was revealed in sound:<br>
Light floated round the marvellous Vision’s brow<br>
And on her lips the Immortal’s joy took shape.<br>
“O strong forerunner, I have heard thy cry.<br>
One shall descend and break the iron Law,<br>
Change Nature’s doom by the lone spirit’s power.<br>
A limitless Mind that can contain the world,<br>
A sweet and violent heart of ardent calms<br>
Moved by the passions of the gods shall come.<br>
All mights and greatnesses shall join in her;<br>
Beauty shall walk celestial on the earth,<br>
Delight shall sleep in the cloud-net of her hair,<br>
And in her body as on his homing tree<br>
Immortal Love shall beat his glorious wings.<br>
A music of griefless things shall weave her charm;<br>
The harps of the Perfect shall attune her voice,<br>
The streams of Heaven shall murmur in her laugh,<br>
Her lips shall be the honeycombs of God,<br>
Her limbs his golden jars of ecstasy,<br>
Her breasts the rapture-flowers of Paradise.<br>
She shall bear Wisdom in her voiceless bosom,<br>
Strength shall be with her like a conqueror’s sword<br>
And from her eyes the Eternal’s bliss shall gaze.<br>
A seed shall be sown in Death’s tremendous hour,<br>
A branch of heaven transplant to human soil;<br>
Nature shall overleap her mortal step;<br>
Fate shall be changed by an unchanging will.”<br>
As a flame disappears in endless Light<br>
Immortally extinguished in its source,<br>
Vanished the splendour and was stilled the word.<br>
An echo of delight that once was close,<br>
The harmony journeyed towards some distant hush,<br>
A music failing in the ear of trance,<br>
A cadence called by distant cadences,<br>
A voice that trembled into strains withdrawn.<br>
<br>
346<br>

CANTO IV: The Vision and the Boon<br>
<br>
Her form retreated from the longing earth<br>
Forsaking nearness to the abandoned sense,<br>
Ascending to her unattainable home.<br>
Lone, brilliant, vacant lay the inner fields;<br>
All was unfilled inordinate spirit space,<br>
Indifferent, waste, a desert of bright peace.<br>
Then a line moved on the far edge of calm:<br>
The warm-lipped sentient soft terrestrial wave,<br>
A quick and many-murmured moan and laugh,<br>
Came gliding in upon white feet of sound.<br>
Unlocked was the deep glory of Silence’ heart;<br>
The absolute unmoving stillnesses<br>
Surrendered to the breath of mortal air,<br>
Dissolving boundlessly the heavens of trance<br>
Collapsed to waking mind. Eternity<br>
Cast down its incommunicable lids<br>
Over its solitudes remote from ken<br>
Behind the voiceless mystery of sleep.<br>
The grandiose respite failed, the wide release.<br>
Across the light of fast-receding planes<br>
That fled from him as from a falling star,<br>
Compelled to fill its human house in Time<br>
His soul drew back into the speed and noise<br>
Of the vast business of created things.<br>
A chariot of the marvels of the heavens<br>
Broad-based to bear the gods on fiery wheels,<br>
Flaming he swept through the spiritual gates.<br>
The mortal stir received him in its midst.<br>
Once more he moved amid material scenes,<br>
Lifted by intimations from the heights<br>
And in the pauses of the building brain<br>
Touched by the thoughts that skim the fathomless surge<br>
Of Nature and wing back to hidden shores.<br>
The eternal seeker in the aeonic field<br>
Besieged by the intolerant press of hours<br>
Again was strong for great swift-footed deeds.<br>

Awake beneath the ignorant vault of Night,<br>
He saw the unnumbered people of the stars<br>
And heard the questioning of the unsatisfied flood<br>
And toiled with the form-maker, measuring Mind.<br>
A wanderer from the occult invisible suns<br>
Accomplishing the fate of transient things,<br>
A god in the figure of the arisen beast,<br>
He raised his brow of conquest to the heavens<br>
Establishing the empire of the soul<br>
On Matter and its bounded universe<br>
As on a solid rock in infinite seas.<br>
The Lord of Life resumed his mighty rounds<br>
In the scant field of the ambiguous globe.<br>

The Birth and Childhood of the Flame<br>
A MAENAD of the cycles of desire<br>
Around a Light she must not dare to touch,<br>
Hastening towards a far-off unknown goal<br>
Earth followed the endless journey of the Sun.<br>
A mind but half-awake in the swing of the void<br>
On the bosom of Inconscience dreamed out life<br>
And bore this finite world of thought and deed<br>
Across the immobile trance of the Infinite.<br>
A vast immutable silence with her ran:<br>
Prisoner of speed upon a jewelled wheel,<br>
She communed with the mystic heart in Space.<br>
Amid the ambiguous stillness of the stars<br>
She moved towards some undisclosed event<br>
And her rhythm measured the long whirl of Time.<br>
In ceaseless motion round the purple rim<br>
Day after day sped by like coloured spokes,<br>
And through a glamour of shifting hues of air<br>
The seasons drew in linked significant dance<br>
The symbol pageant of the changing year.<br>
Across the burning languor of the soil<br>
Paced Summer with his pomp of violent noons<br>
And stamped his tyranny of torrid light<br>
And the blue seal of a great burnished sky.<br>
Next through its fiery swoon or clotted knot<br>
Rain-tide burst in upon torn wings of heat,<br>
Startled with lightnings air’s unquiet drowse,<br>
Lashed with life-giving streams the torpid soil,<br>
Overcast with flare and sound and storm-winged dark<br>
The star-defended doors of heaven’s dim sleep,<br>
Or from the gold eye of her paramour<br>
Covered with packed cloud-veils the earth’s brown face.<br>

Armies of revolution crossed the time-field,<br>
The clouds’ unending march besieged the world,<br>
Tempests’ pronunciamentos claimed the sky<br>
And thunder drums announced the embattled gods.<br>
A traveller from unquiet neighbouring seas,<br>
The dense-maned monsoon rode neighing through earth’s hours:<br>
Thick now the emissary javelins:<br>
Enormous lightnings split the horizon’s rim<br>
And, hurled from the quarters as from contending camps,<br>
Married heaven’s edges steep and bare and blind:<br>
A surge and hiss and onset of huge rain,<br>
The long straight sleet-drift, clamours of winged storm-charge,<br>
Throngs of wind-faces, rushing of wind-feet<br>
Hurrying swept through the prone afflicted plains:<br>
Heaven’s waters trailed and dribbled through the drowned land.<br>
Then all was a swift stride, a sibilant race,<br>
Or all was tempest’s shout and water’s fall.<br>
A dimness sagged on the grey floor of day,<br>
Its dingy sprawling length joined morn to eve,<br>
Wallowing in sludge and shower it reached black dark.<br>
Day a half darkness wore as its dull dress.<br>
Light looked into dawn’s tarnished glass and met<br>
Its own face there, twin to a half-lit night’s:<br>
Downpour and drip and seeping mist swayed all<br>
And turned dry soil to bog and reeking mud:<br>
Earth was a quagmire, heaven a dismal block.<br>
None saw through dank drenched weeks the dungeon sun.<br>
Even when no turmoil vexed air’s sombre rest,<br>
Or a faint ray glimmered through weeping clouds<br>
As a sad smile gleams veiled by returning tears,<br>
All promised brightness failed at once denied<br>
Or, soon condemned, died like a brief-lived hope.<br>
Then a last massive deluge thrashed dead mire<br>
And a subsiding mutter left all still,<br>
Or only the muddy creep of sinking floods<br>
Or only a whisper and green toss of trees.<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Birth and Childhood of the Flame<br>
<br>
Earth’s mood now changed; she lay in lulled repose,<br>
The hours went by with slow contented tread:<br>
A wide and tranquil air remembered peace,<br>
Earth was the comrade of a happy sun.<br>
A calmness neared as of the approach of God,<br>
A light of musing trance lit soil and sky<br>
And an identity and ecstasy<br>
Filled meditation’s solitary heart.<br>
A dream loitered in the dumb mind of Space,<br>
Time opened its chambers of felicity,<br>
An exaltation entered and a hope:<br>
An inmost self looked up to a heavenlier height,<br>
An inmost thought kindled a hidden flame<br>
And the inner sight adored an unseen sun.<br>
Three thoughtful seasons passed with shining tread<br>
And scanning one by one the pregnant hours<br>
Watched for a flame that lurked in luminous depths,<br>
The vigil of some mighty birth to come.<br>
Autumn led in the glory of her moons<br>
And dreamed in the splendour of her lotus pools<br>
And Winter and Dew-time laid their calm cool hands<br>
On Nature’s bosom still in a half sleep<br>
And deepened with hues of lax and mellow ease<br>
The tranquil beauty of the waning year.<br>
Then Spring, an ardent lover, leaped through leaves<br>
And caught the earth-bride in his eager clasp;<br>
His advent was a fire of irised hues,<br>
His arms were a circle of the arrival of joy.<br>
His voice was a call to the Transcendent’s sphere<br>
Whose secret touch upon our mortal lives<br>
Keeps ever new the thrill that made the world,<br>
Remoulds an ancient sweetness to new shapes<br>
And guards intact unchanged by death and Time<br>
The answer of our hearts to Nature’s charm<br>
And keeps for ever new, yet still the same,<br>
The throb that ever wakes to the old delight<br>

<br>
And beauty and rapture and the joy to live.<br>
His coming brought the magic and the spell;<br>
At his touch life’s tired heart grew glad and young;<br>
He made joy a willing prisoner in her breast.<br>
His grasp was a young god’s upon earth’s limbs:<br>
Changed by the passion of his divine outbreak<br>
He made her body beautiful with his kiss.<br>
Impatient for felicity he came,<br>
High-fluting with the coı̈l’s happy voice,<br>
His peacock turban trailing on the trees;<br>
His breath was a warm summons to delight,<br>
The dense voluptuous azure was his gaze.<br>
A soft celestial urge surprised the blood<br>
Rich with the instinct of God’s sensuous joys;<br>
Revealed in beauty, a cadence was abroad<br>
Insistent on the rapture-thrill in life:<br>
Immortal movements touched the fleeting hours.<br>
A godlike packed intensity of sense<br>
Made it a passionate pleasure even to breathe;<br>
All sights and voices wove a single charm.<br>
The life of the enchanted globe became<br>
A storm of sweetness and of light and song,<br>
A revel of colour and of ecstasy,<br>
A hymn of rays, a litany of cries:<br>
A strain of choral priestly music sang<br>
And, swung on the swaying censer of the trees,<br>
A sacrifice of perfume filled the hours.<br>
Asocas burned in crimson spots of flame,<br>
Pure like the breath of an unstained desire<br>
White jasmines haunted the enamoured air,<br>
Pale mango-blossoms fed the liquid voice<br>
Of the love-maddened coı̈l, and the brown bee<br>
Muttered in fragrance mid the honey-buds.<br>
The sunlight was a great god’s golden smile.<br>
All Nature was at beauty’s festival.<br>

<br>
In this high signal moment of the gods<br>
Answering earth’s yearning and her cry for bliss,<br>
A greatness from our other countries came.<br>
A silence in the noise of earthly things<br>
Immutably revealed the secret Word,<br>
A mightier influx filled the oblivious clay:<br>
A lamp was lit, a sacred image made.<br>
A mediating ray had touched the earth<br>
Bridging the gulf between man’s mind and God’s;<br>
Its brightness linked our transience to the Unknown.<br>
A spirit of its celestial source aware<br>
Translating heaven into a human shape<br>
Descended into earth’s imperfect mould<br>
And wept not fallen to mortality,<br>
But looked on all with large and tranquil eyes.<br>
One had returned from the transcendent planes<br>
And bore anew the load of mortal breath,<br>
Who had striven of old with our darkness and our pain;<br>
She took again her divine unfinished task:<br>
Survivor of death and the aeonic years,<br>
Once more with her fathomless heart she fronted Time.<br>
Again there was renewed, again revealed<br>
The ancient closeness by earth-vision veiled,<br>
The secret contact broken off in Time,<br>
A consanguinity of earth and heaven,<br>
Between the human portion toiling here<br>
And an as yet unborn and limitless Force.<br>
Again the mystic deep attempt began,<br>
The daring wager of the cosmic game.<br>
For since upon this blind and whirling globe<br>
Earth-plasm first quivered with the illumining mind<br>
And life invaded the material sheath<br>
Afflicting Inconscience with the need to feel,<br>
Since in Infinity’s silence woke a word,<br>
A Mother-wisdom works in Nature’s breast<br>
To pour delight on the heart of toil and want<br>

And press perfection on life’s stumbling powers,<br>
Impose heaven-sentience on the obscure abyss<br>
And make dumb Matter conscious of its God.<br>
Although our fallen minds forget to climb,<br>
Although our human stuff resists or breaks,<br>
She keeps her will that hopes to divinise clay;<br>
Failure cannot repress, defeat o’erthrow;<br>
Time cannot weary her nor the Void subdue,<br>
The ages have not made her passion less;<br>
No victory she admits of Death or Fate.<br>
Always she drives the soul to new attempt;<br>
Always her magical infinitude<br>
Forces to aspire the inert brute elements;<br>
As one who has all infinity to waste,<br>
She scatters the seed of the Eternal’s strength<br>
On a half-animate and crumbling mould,<br>
Plants heaven’s delight in the heart’s passionate mire,<br>
Pours godhead’s seekings into a bare beast frame,<br>
Hides immortality in a mask of death.<br>
Once more that Will put on an earthly shape.<br>
A Mind empowered from Truth’s immutable seat<br>
Was framed for vision and interpreting act<br>
And instruments were sovereignly designed<br>
To express divinity in terrestrial signs.<br>
Outlined by the pressure of this new descent<br>
A lovelier body formed than earth had known.<br>
As yet a prophecy only and a hint,<br>
The glowing arc of a charmed unseen whole,<br>
It came into the sky of mortal life<br>
Bright like the crescent horn of a gold moon<br>
Returning in a faint illumined eve.<br>
At first glimmering like an unshaped idea<br>
Passive she lay sheltered in wordless sleep,<br>
Involved and drowned in Matter’s giant trance,<br>
An infant heart of the deep-caved world-plan<br>
In cradle of divine inconscience rocked<br>
<br>

CANTO I: The Birth and Childhood of the Flame<br>
<br>
By the universal ecstasy of the suns.<br>
Some missioned Power in the half-wakened frame<br>
Nursed a transcendent birth’s dumb glorious seed<br>
For which this vivid tenement was made.<br>
But soon the link of soul with form grew sure;<br>
Flooded was the dim cave with slow conscient light,<br>
The seed grew into a delicate marvellous bud,<br>
The bud disclosed a great and heavenly bloom.<br>
At once she seemed to found a mightier race.<br>
Arrived upon the strange and dubious globe<br>
The child remembering inly a far home<br>
Lived guarded in her spirit’s luminous cell,<br>
Alone mid men in her diviner kind.<br>
Even in her childish movements could be felt<br>
The nearness of a light still kept from earth,<br>
Feelings that only eternity could share,<br>
Thoughts natural and native to the gods.<br>
As needing nothing but its own rapt flight<br>
Her nature dwelt in a strong separate air<br>
Like a strange bird with large rich-coloured breast<br>
That sojourns on a secret fruited bough,<br>
Lost in the emerald glory of the woods<br>
Or flies above divine unreachable tops.<br>
Harmoniously she impressed the earth with heaven.<br>
Aligned to a swift rhythm of sheer delight<br>
And singing to themselves her days went by;<br>
Each minute was a throb of beauty’s heart;<br>
The hours were tuned to a sweet-toned content<br>
Which asked for nothing, but took all life gave<br>
Sovereignly as her nature’s inborn right.<br>
Near was her spirit to its parent Sun,<br>
The Breath within to the eternal joy.<br>
The first fair life that breaks from Nature’s swoon,<br>
Mounts in a line of rapture to the skies;<br>
Absorbed in its own happy urge it lives,<br>
Sufficient to itself, yet turned to all:<br>

<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
It has no seen communion with its world,<br>
No open converse with surrounding things.<br>
There is a oneness native and occult<br>
That needs no instruments and erects no form;<br>
In unison it grows with all that is.<br>
All contacts it assumes into its trance,<br>
Laugh-tossed consents to the wind’s kiss and takes<br>
Transmutingly the shocks of sun and breeze:<br>
A blissful yearning riots in its leaves,<br>
A magic passion trembles in its blooms,<br>
Its boughs aspire in hushed felicity.<br>
An occult godhead of this beauty is cause,<br>
The spirit and intimate guest of all this charm,<br>
This sweetness’s priestess and this reverie’s muse.<br>
Invisibly protected from our sense<br>
The Dryad lives drenched in a deeper ray<br>
And feels another air of storms and calms<br>
And quivers inwardly with mystic rain.<br>
This at a heavenlier height was shown in her.<br>
Even when she bent to meet earth’s intimacies<br>
Her spirit kept the stature of the gods;<br>
It stooped but was not lost in Matter’s reign.<br>
A world translated was her gleaming mind,<br>
And marvel-mooned bright crowding fantasies<br>
Fed with spiritual sustenance of dreams<br>
The ideal goddess in her house of gold.<br>
Aware of forms to which our eyes are closed,<br>
Conscious of nearnesses we cannot feel,<br>
The Power within her shaped her moulding sense<br>
In deeper figures than our surface types.<br>
An invisible sunlight ran within her veins<br>
And flooded her brain with heavenly brilliances<br>
That woke a wider sight than earth could know.<br>
Outlined in the sincerity of that ray<br>
Her springing childlike thoughts were richly turned<br>
Into luminous patterns of her soul’s deep truth,<br>

<br>
And from her eyes she cast another look<br>
On all around her than man’s ignorant view.<br>
All objects were to her shapes of living selves<br>
And she perceived a message from her kin<br>
In each awakening touch of outward things.<br>
Each was a symbol power, a vivid flash<br>
In the circuit of infinities half-known;<br>
Nothing was alien or inanimate,<br>
Nothing without its meaning or its call.<br>
For with a greater Nature she was one.<br>
As from the soil sprang glory of branch and flower,<br>
As from the animal’s life rose thinking man,<br>
A new epiphany appeared in her.<br>
A mind of light, a life of rhythmic force,<br>
A body instinct with hidden divinity<br>
Prepared an image of the coming god;<br>
And when the slow rhyme of the expanding years<br>
And the rich murmurous swarm-work of the days<br>
Had honey-packed her sense and filled her limbs,<br>
Accomplishing the moon-orb of her grace,<br>
Self-guarded in the silence of her strength<br>
Her solitary greatness was not less.<br>
Nearer the godhead to the surface pressed,<br>
A sun replacing childhood’s nebula<br>
Sovereign in a blue and lonely sky.<br>
Upward it rose to grasp the human scene:<br>
The strong Inhabitant turned to watch her field.<br>
A lovelier light assumed her spirit brow<br>
And sweet and solemn grew her musing gaze;<br>
Celestial-human deep warm slumbrous fires<br>
Woke in the long fringed glory of her eyes<br>
Like altar-burnings in a mysteried shrine.<br>
Out of those crystal windows gleamed a will<br>
That brought a large significance to life.<br>
Holding her forehead’s candid stainless space<br>
Behind the student arch a noble power<br>

<br>
Of wisdom looked from light on transient things.<br>
A scout of victory in a vigil tower,<br>
Her aspiration called high destiny down;<br>
A silent warrior paced in her city of strength<br>
Inviolate, guarding Truth’s diamond throne.<br>
A nectarous haloed moon her passionate heart<br>
Loved all and spoke no word and made no sign,<br>
But kept her bosom’s rapturous secrecy<br>
A blissful ardent moved and voiceless world.<br>
Proud, swift and joyful ran the wave of life<br>
Within her like a stream in Paradise.<br>
Many high gods dwelt in one beautiful home;<br>
Yet was her nature’s orb a perfect whole,<br>
Harmonious like a chant with many tones,<br>
Immense and various like a universe.<br>
The body that held this greatness seemed almost<br>
An image made of heaven’s transparent light.<br>
Its charm recalled things seen in vision’s hours,<br>
A golden bridge spanning a faery flood,<br>
A moon-touched palm-tree single by a lake<br>
Companion of the wide and glimmering peace,<br>
A murmur as of leaves in Paradise<br>
Moving when feet of the Immortals pass,<br>
A fiery halo over sleeping hills,<br>
A strange and starry head alone in Night.<br>

<br>
The Growth of the Flame<br>
A LAND of mountains and wide sun-beat plains<br>
And giant rivers pacing to vast seas,<br>
A field of creation and spiritual hush,<br>
Silence swallowing life’s acts into the deeps,<br>
Of thought’s transcendent climb and heavenward leap,<br>
A brooding world of reverie and trance,<br>
Filled with the mightiest works of God and man,<br>
Where Nature seemed a dream of the Divine<br>
And beauty and grace and grandeur had their home,<br>
Harboured the childhood of the incarnate Flame.<br>
Over her watched millennial influences<br>
And the deep godheads of a grandiose past<br>
Looked on her and saw the future’s godheads come<br>
As if this magnet drew their powers unseen.<br>
Earth’s brooding wisdom spoke to her still breast;<br>
Mounting from mind’s last peaks to mate with gods,<br>
Making earth’s brilliant thoughts a springing-board<br>
To dive into the cosmic vastnesses,<br>
The knowledge of the thinker and the seer<br>
Saw the unseen and thought the unthinkable,<br>
Opened the enormous doors of the unknown,<br>
Rent man’s horizons into infinity.<br>
A shoreless sweep was lent to the mortal’s acts,<br>
And art and beauty sprang from the human depths;<br>
Nature and soul vied in nobility.<br>
Ethics the human keyed to imitate heaven;<br>
The harmony of a rich culture’s tones<br>
Refined the sense and magnified its reach<br>
To hear the unheard and glimpse the invisible<br>
And taught the soul to soar beyond things known,<br>
Inspiring life to greaten and break its bounds,<br>
<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
Aspiring to the Immortals’ unseen world.<br>
Leaving earth’s safety daring wings of Mind<br>
Bore her above the trodden fields of thought<br>
Crossing the mystic seas of the Beyond<br>
To live on eagle heights near to the Sun.<br>
There Wisdom sits on her eternal throne.<br>
All her life’s turns led her to symbol doors<br>
Admitting to secret Powers that were her kin;<br>
Adept of truth, initiate of bliss,<br>
A mystic acolyte trained in Nature’s school,<br>
Aware of the marvel of created things<br>
She laid the secrecies of her heart’s deep muse<br>
Upon the altar of the Wonderful;<br>
Her hours were a ritual in a timeless fane;<br>
Her acts became gestures of sacrifice.<br>
Invested with a rhythm of higher spheres<br>
The word was used as a hieratic means<br>
For the release of the imprisoned spirit<br>
Into communion with its comrade gods.<br>
Or it helped to beat out new expressive forms<br>
Of that which labours in the heart of life,<br>
Some immemorial Soul in men and things,<br>
Seeker of the unknown and the unborn<br>
Carrying a light from the Ineffable<br>
To rend the veil of the last mysteries.<br>
Intense philosophies pointed earth to heaven<br>
Or on foundations broad as cosmic Space<br>
Upraised the earth-mind to superhuman heights.<br>
Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes<br>
But hide the sight of that which lives within<br>
Sculpture and painting concentrated sense<br>
Upon an inner vision’s motionless verge,<br>
Revealed a figure of the invisible,<br>
Unveiled all Nature’s meaning in a form,<br>
Or caught into a body the Divine.<br>
The architecture of the Infinite<br>
<br>

CANTO II: The Growth of the Flame<br>
<br>
Discovered here its inward-musing shapes<br>
Captured into wide breadths of soaring stone:<br>
Music brought down celestial yearnings, song<br>
Held the merged heart absorbed in rapturous depths,<br>
Linking the human with the cosmic cry;<br>
The world-interpreting movements of the dance<br>
Moulded idea and mood to a rhythmic sway<br>
And posture; crafts minute in subtle lines<br>
Eternised a swift moment’s memory<br>
Or showed in a carving’s sweep, a cup’s design<br>
The underlying patterns of the unseen:<br>
Poems in largeness cast like moving worlds<br>
And metres surging with the ocean’s voice<br>
Translated by grandeurs locked in Nature’s heart<br>
But thrown now into a crowded glory of speech<br>
The beauty and sublimity of her forms,<br>
The passion of her moments and her moods<br>
Lifting the human word nearer to the god’s.<br>
Man’s eyes could look into the inner realms;<br>
His scrutiny discovered number’s law<br>
And organised the motions of the stars,<br>
Mapped out the visible fashioning of the world,<br>
Questioned the process of his thoughts or made<br>
A theorised diagram of mind and life.<br>
These things she took in as her nature’s food,<br>
But these alone could fill not her wide Self:<br>
A human seeking limited by its gains,<br>
To her they seemed the great and early steps<br>
Hazardous of a young discovering spirit<br>
Which saw not yet by its own native light;<br>
It tapped the universe with testing knocks<br>
Or stretched to find truth mind’s divining rod;<br>
There was a growing out to numberless sides,<br>
But not the widest seeing of the soul,<br>
Not yet the vast direct immediate touch,<br>
Nor yet the art and wisdom of the Gods.<br>
<br>
361<br>
<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
A boundless knowledge greater than man’s thought,<br>
A happiness too high for heart and sense<br>
Locked in the world and yearning for release<br>
She felt in her; waiting as yet for form,<br>
It asked for objects around which to grow<br>
And natures strong to bear without recoil<br>
The splendour of her native royalty,<br>
Her greatness and her sweetness and her bliss,<br>
Her might to possess and her vast power to love:<br>
Earth made a stepping-stone to conquer heaven,<br>
The soul saw beyond heaven’s limiting boundaries,<br>
Met a great light from the Unknowable<br>
And dreamed of a transcendent action’s sphere.<br>
Aware of the universal Self in all<br>
She turned to living hearts and human forms,<br>
Her soul’s reflections, complements, counterparts,<br>
The close outlying portions of her being<br>
Divided from her by walls of body and mind<br>
Yet to her spirit bound by ties divine.<br>
Overcoming invisible hedge and masked defence<br>
And the loneliness that separates soul from soul,<br>
She wished to make all one immense embrace<br>
That she might house in it all living things<br>
Raised into a splendid point of seeing light<br>
Out of division’s dense inconscient cleft,<br>
And make them one with God and world and her.<br>
Only a few responded to her call:<br>
Still fewer felt the screened divinity<br>
And strove to mate its godhead with their own,<br>
Approaching with some kinship to her heights.<br>
Uplifted towards luminous secrecies<br>
Or conscious of some splendour hidden above<br>
They leaped to find her in a moment’s flash,<br>
Glimpsing a light in a celestial vast,<br>
But could not keep the vision and the power<br>
And fell back to life’s dull ordinary tone.<br>
<br>
362<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Growth of the Flame<br>
<br>
A mind daring heavenly experiment,<br>
Growing towards some largeness they felt near,<br>
Testing the unknown’s bound with eager touch<br>
They still were prisoned by their human grain:<br>
They could not keep up with her tireless step;<br>
Too small and eager for her large-paced will,<br>
Too narrow to look with the unborn Infinite’s gaze<br>
Their nature weary grew of things too great.<br>
For even the close partners of her thoughts<br>
Who could have walked the nearest to her ray,<br>
Worshipped the power and light they felt in her<br>
But could not match the measure of her soul.<br>
A friend and yet too great wholly to know,<br>
She walked in their front towards a greater light,<br>
Their leader and queen over their hearts and souls,<br>
One close to their bosoms, yet divine and far.<br>
Admiring and amazed they saw her stride<br>
Attempting with a godlike rush and leap<br>
Heights for their human stature too remote<br>
Or with a slow great many-sided toil<br>
Pushing towards aims they hardly could conceive;<br>
Yet forced to be the satellites of her sun<br>
They moved unable to forego her light,<br>
Desiring they clutched at her with outstretched hands<br>
Or followed stumbling in the paths she made.<br>
Or longing with their self of life and flesh<br>
They clung to her for heart’s nourishment and support:<br>
The rest they could not see in visible light;<br>
Vaguely they bore her inner mightiness.<br>
Or bound by the senses and the longing heart,<br>
Adoring with a turbid human love,<br>
They could not grasp the mighty spirit she was<br>
Or change by closeness to be even as she.<br>
Some felt her with their souls and thrilled with her,<br>
A greatness felt near yet beyond mind’s grasp;<br>
To see her was a summons to adore,<br>
<br>
363<br>
<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
To be near her drew a high communion’s force.<br>
So men worship a god too great to know,<br>
Too high, too vast to wear a limiting shape;<br>
They feel a Presence and obey a might,<br>
Adore a love whose rapture invades their breasts;<br>
To a divine ardour quickening the heart-beats,<br>
A law they follow greatening heart and life.<br>
Opened to the breath is a new diviner air,<br>
Opened to man is a freer, happier world:<br>
He sees high steps climbing to Self and Light.<br>
Her divine parts the soul’s allegiance called:<br>
It saw, it felt, it knew the deity.<br>
Her will was puissant on their nature’s acts,<br>
Her heart’s inexhaustible sweetness lured their hearts,<br>
A being they loved whose bounds exceeded theirs;<br>
Her measure they could not reach but bore her touch,<br>
Answering with the flower’s answer to the sun<br>
They gave themselves to her and asked no more.<br>
One greater than themselves, too wide for their ken,<br>
Their minds could not understand nor wholly know,<br>
Their lives replied to hers, moved at her words:<br>
They felt a godhead and obeyed a call,<br>
Answered to her lead and did her work in the world;<br>
Their lives, their natures moved compelled by hers<br>
As if the truth of their own larger selves<br>
Put on an aspect of divinity<br>
To exalt them to a pitch beyond their earth’s.<br>
They felt a larger future meet their walk;<br>
She held their hands, she chose for them their paths:<br>
They were moved by her towards great unknown things,<br>
Faith drew them and the joy to feel themselves hers;<br>
They lived in her, they saw the world with her eyes.<br>
Some turned to her against their nature’s bent;<br>
Divided between wonder and revolt,<br>
Drawn by her charm and mastered by her will,<br>
Possessed by her, her striving to possess,<br>
<br>
364<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Growth of the Flame<br>
<br>
Impatient subjects, their tied longing hearts<br>
Hugging the bonds close of which they most complained,<br>
Murmured at a yoke they would have wept to lose,<br>
The splendid yoke of her beauty and her love:<br>
Others pursued her with life’s blind desires<br>
And claiming all of her as their lonely own,<br>
Hastened to engross her sweetness meant for all.<br>
As earth claims light for its lone separate need<br>
Demanding her for their sole jealous clasp,<br>
They asked from her movements bounded like their own<br>
And to their smallness craved a like response.<br>
Or they repined that she surpassed their grip,<br>
And hoped to bind her close with longing’s cords.<br>
Or finding her touch desired too strong to bear<br>
They blamed her for a tyranny they loved,<br>
Shrank into themselves as from too bright a sun,<br>
Yet hankered for the splendour they refused.<br>
Angrily enamoured of her sweet passionate ray<br>
The weakness of their earth could hardly bear,<br>
They longed but cried out at the touch desired<br>
Inapt to meet divinity so close,<br>
Intolerant of a Force they could not house.<br>
Some drawn unwillingly by her divine sway<br>
Endured it like a sweet but alien spell;<br>
Unable to mount to levels too sublime,<br>
They yearned to draw her down to their own earth.<br>
Or forced to centre round her their passionate lives,<br>
They hoped to bind to their heart’s human needs<br>
Her glory and grace that had enslaved their souls.<br>
But mid this world, these hearts that answered her call,<br>
None could stand up her equal and her mate.<br>
In vain she stooped to equal them with her heights,<br>
Too pure that air was for small souls to breathe.<br>
These comrade selves to raise to her own wide breadths<br>
Her heart desired and fill with her own power<br>

That a diviner Force might enter life,<br>
A breath of Godhead greaten human time.<br>
Although she leaned down to their littleness<br>
Covering their lives with her strong passionate hands<br>
And knew by sympathy their needs and wants<br>
And dived in the shallow wave-depths of their lives<br>
And met and shared their heart-beats of grief and joy<br>
And bent to heal their sorrow and their pride,<br>
Lavishing the might that was hers on her lone peak<br>
To lift to it their aspiration’s cry,<br>
And though she drew their souls into her vast<br>
And surrounded with the silence of her deeps<br>
And held as the great Mother holds her own,<br>
Only her earthly surface bore their charge<br>
And mixed its fire with their mortality:<br>
Her greater self lived sole, unclaimed, within.<br>
Oftener in dumb Nature’s stir and peace<br>
A nearness she could feel serenely one;<br>
The Force in her drew earth’s subhuman broods;<br>
And to her spirit’s large and free delight<br>
She joined the ardent-hued magnificent lives<br>
Of animal and bird and flower and tree.<br>
They answered to her with the simple heart.<br>
In man a dim disturbing somewhat lives;<br>
It knows but turns away from divine Light<br>
Preferring the dark ignorance of the fall.<br>
Among the many who came drawn to her<br>
Nowhere she found her partner of high tasks,<br>
The comrade of her soul, her other self<br>
Who was made with her, like God and Nature, one.<br>
Some near approached, were touched, caught fire, then failed,<br>
Too great was her demand, too pure her force.<br>
Thus lighting earth around her like a sun,<br>
Yet in her inmost sky an orb aloof,<br>
A distance severed her from those most close.<br>
Puissant, apart her soul as the gods live.<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Growth of the Flame<br>
<br>
As yet unlinked with the broad human scene,<br>
In a small circle of young eager hearts,<br>
Her being’s early school and closed domain,<br>
Apprentice in the business of earth-life,<br>
She schooled her heavenly strain to bear its touch,<br>
Content in her little garden of the gods<br>
As blooms a flower in an unvisited place.<br>
Earth nursed, unconscious still, the inhabiting flame,<br>
Yet something deeply stirred and dimly knew;<br>
There was a movement and a passionate call,<br>
A rainbow dream, a hope of golden change;<br>
Some secret wing of expectation beat,<br>
A growing sense of something new and rare<br>
And beautiful stole across the heart of Time.<br>
Then a faint whisper of her touched the soil,<br>
Breathed like a hidden need the soul divines;<br>
The eye of the great world discovered her<br>
And wonder lifted up its bardic voice.<br>
A key to a Light still kept in being’s cave,<br>
The sun-word of an ancient mystery’s sense,<br>
Her name ran murmuring on the lips of men<br>
Exalted and sweet like an inspired verse<br>
Struck from the epic lyre of rumour’s winds<br>
Or sung like a chanted thought by the poet Fame.<br>
But like a sacred symbol’s was that cult.<br>
Admired, unsought, intangible to the grasp<br>
Her beauty and flaming strength were seen afar<br>
Like lightning playing with the fallen day,<br>
A glory unapproachably divine.<br>
No equal heart came close to join her heart,<br>
No transient earthly love assailed her calm,<br>
No hero passion had the strength to seize;<br>
No eyes demanded her replying eyes.<br>
A Power within her awed the imperfect flesh;<br>
The self-protecting genius in our clay<br>
Divined the goddess in the woman’s shape<br>

<br>
And drew back from a touch beyond its kind<br>
The earth-nature bound in sense-life’s narrow make.<br>
The hearts of men are amorous of clay-kin<br>
And bear not spirits lone and high who bring<br>
Fire-intimations from the deathless planes<br>
Too vast for souls not born to mate with heaven.<br>
Whoever is too great must lonely live.<br>
Adored he walks in mighty solitude;<br>
Vain is his labour to create his kind,<br>
His only comrade is the Strength within.<br>
Thus was it for a while with Savitri.<br>
All worshipped marvellingly, none dared to claim.<br>
Her mind sat high pouring its golden beams,<br>
Her heart was a crowded temple of delight.<br>
A single lamp lit in perfection’s house,<br>
A bright pure image in a priestless shrine,<br>
Midst those encircling lives her spirit dwelt,<br>
Apart in herself until her hour of fate.<br>

A MORN that seemed a new creation’s front,<br>
Bringing a greater sunlight, happier skies,<br>
Came burdened with a beauty moved and strange<br>
Out of the changeless origin of things.<br>
An ancient longing struck again new roots:<br>
The air drank deep of unfulfilled desire;<br>
The high trees trembled with a wandering wind<br>
Like souls that quiver at the approach of joy,<br>
And in a bosom of green secrecy<br>
For ever of its one love-note untired<br>
A lyric coı̈l cried among the leaves.<br>
Away from the terrestrial murmur turned<br>
Where transient calls and answers mix their flood,<br>
King Aswapati listened through the ray<br>
To other sounds than meet the sense-formed ear.<br>
On a subtle interspace which rings our life,<br>
Unlocked were the inner spirit’s trance-closed doors:<br>
The inaudible strain in Nature could be caught;<br>
Across this cyclic tramp of eager lives,<br>
Across the deep urgency of present cares,<br>
Earth’s wordless hymn to the Ineffable<br>
Arose from the silent heart of the cosmic Void;<br>
He heard the voice repressed of unborn Powers<br>
Murmuring behind the luminous bars of Time.<br>
Again the mighty yearning raised its flame<br>
That asks a perfect life on earth for men<br>
And prays for certainty in the uncertain mind<br>
And shadowless bliss for suffering human hearts<br>
And Truth embodied in an ignorant world<br>
And godhead divinising mortal forms.<br>
A word that leaped from some far sky of thought,<br>
<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
Admitted by the cowled receiving scribe<br>
Traversed the echoing passages of his brain<br>
And left its stamp on the recording cells.<br>
“O Force-compelled, Fate-driven earth-born race,<br>
O petty adventurers in an infinite world<br>
And prisoners of a dwarf humanity,<br>
How long will you tread the circling tracks of mind<br>
Around your little self and petty things?<br>
But not for a changeless littleness were you meant,<br>
Not for vain repetition were you built;<br>
Out of the Immortal’s substance you were made;<br>
Your actions can be swift revealing steps,<br>
Your life a changeful mould for growing gods.<br>
A Seer, a strong Creator, is within,<br>
The immaculate Grandeur broods upon your days,<br>
Almighty powers are shut in Nature’s cells.<br>
A greater destiny waits you in your front:<br>
This transient earthly being if he wills<br>
Can fit his acts to a transcendent scheme.<br>
He who now stares at the world with ignorant eyes<br>
Hardly from the Inconscient’s night aroused,<br>
That look at images and not at Truth,<br>
Can fill those orbs with an immortal’s sight.<br>
Yet shall the godhead grow within your hearts,<br>
You shall awake into the spirit’s air<br>
And feel the breaking walls of mortal mind<br>
And hear the message which left life’s heart dumb<br>
And look through Nature with sun-gazing lids<br>
And blow your conch-shells at the Eternal’s gate.<br>
Authors of earth’s high change, to you it is given<br>
To cross the dangerous spaces of the soul<br>
And touch the mighty Mother stark awake<br>
And meet the Omnipotent in this house of flesh<br>
And make of life the million-bodied One.<br>
The earth you tread is a border screened from heaven;<br>
The life you lead conceals the light you are.<br>

<br>
Immortal Powers sweep flaming past your doors;<br>
Far-off upon your tops the god-chant sounds<br>
While to exceed yourselves thought’s trumpets call,<br>
Heard by a few, but fewer dare aspire,<br>
The nympholepts of the ecstasy and the blaze.<br>
An epic of hope and failure breaks earth’s heart;<br>
Her force and will exceed her form and fate.<br>
A goddess in a net of transience caught,<br>
Self-bound in the pastures of death she dreams of life,<br>
Self-racked with the pains of hell aspires to joy,<br>
And builds to hope her altars of despair,<br>
Knows that one high step might enfranchise all<br>
And, suffering, looks for greatness in her sons.<br>
But dim in human hearts the ascending fire,<br>
The invisible Grandeur sits unworshipped there;<br>
Man sees the Highest in a limiting form<br>
Or looks upon a Person, hears a Name.<br>
He turns for little gains to ignorant Powers<br>
Or kindles his altar lights to a demon face.<br>
He loves the Ignorance fathering his pain.<br>
A spell is laid upon his glorious strengths;<br>
He has lost the inner Voice that led his thoughts,<br>
And masking the oracular tripod seat<br>
A specious Idol fills the marvel shrine.<br>
The great Illusion wraps him in its veils,<br>
The soul’s deep intimations come in vain,<br>
In vain is the unending line of seers,<br>
The sages ponder in unsubstantial light,<br>
The poets lend their voice to outward dreams,<br>
A homeless fire inspires the prophet tongues.<br>
Heaven’s flaming lights descend and back return,<br>
The luminous Eye approaches and retires;<br>
Eternity speaks, none understands its word;<br>
Fate is unwilling and the Abyss denies;<br>
The Inconscient’s mindless waters block all done.<br>
Only a little lifted is Mind’s screen;<br>

The Wise who know see but one half of Truth,<br>
The strong climb hardly to a low-peaked height,<br>
The hearts that yearn are given one hour to love.<br>
His tale half told, falters the secret Bard;<br>
The gods are still too few in mortal forms.”<br>
The Voice withdrew into its hidden skies.<br>
But like a shining answer from the gods<br>
Approached through sun-bright spaces Savitri.<br>
Advancing amid tall heaven-pillaring trees,<br>
Apparelled in her flickering-coloured robe<br>
She seemed, burning towards the eternal realms,<br>
A bright moved torch of incense and of flame<br>
That from the sky-roofed temple-soil of earth<br>
A pilgrim hand lifts in an invisible shrine.<br>
There came the gift of a revealing hour:<br>
He saw through depths that reinterpret all,<br>
Limited not now by the dull body’s eyes,<br>
New-found through an arch of clear discovery,<br>
This intimation of the world’s delight,<br>
This wonder of the divine Artist’s make<br>
Carved like a nectar-cup for thirsty gods,<br>
This breathing Scripture of the Eternal’s joy,<br>
This net of sweetness woven of aureate fire.<br>
Transformed the delicate image-face became<br>
A deeper Nature’s self-revealing sign,<br>
A gold-leaf palimpsest of sacred births,<br>
A grave world-symbol chiselled out of life.<br>
Her brow, a copy of clear unstained heavens,<br>
Was meditation’s pedestal and defence,<br>
The very room and smile of musing Space,<br>
Its brooding line infinity’s symbol curve.<br>
Amid her tresses’ cloudy multitude<br>
Her long eyes shadowed as by wings of Night<br>
Under that moon-gold forehead’s dreaming breadth<br>
Were seas of love and thought that held the world;<br>
Marvelling at life and earth they saw truths far.<br>

<br>
A deathless meaning filled her mortal limbs;<br>
As in a golden vase’s poignant line<br>
They seemed to carry the rhythmic sob of bliss<br>
Of earth’s mute adoration towards heaven<br>
Released in beauty’s cry of living form<br>
Towards the perfection of eternal things.<br>
Transparent grown the ephemeral living dress<br>
Bared the expressive deity to his view.<br>
Escaped from surface sight and mortal sense<br>
The seizing harmony of its shapes became<br>
The strange significant icon of a Power<br>
Renewing its inscrutable descent<br>
Into a human figure of its works<br>
That stood out in life’s bold abrupt relief<br>
On the soil of the evolving universe,<br>
A godhead sculptured on a wall of thought,<br>
Mirrored in the flowing hours and dimly shrined<br>
In Matter as in a cathedral cave.<br>
Annulled were the transient values of the mind,<br>
The body’s sense renounced its earthly look;<br>
Immortal met immortal in their gaze.<br>
Awaked from the close spell of daily use<br>
That hides soul-truth with the outward form’s disguise,<br>
He saw through the familiar cherished limbs<br>
The great and unknown spirit born his child.<br>
An impromptu from the deeper sight within,<br>
Thoughts rose in him that knew not their own scope.<br>
Then to those large and brooding depths whence Love<br>
Regarded him across the straits of mind,<br>
He spoke in sentences from the unseen Heights.<br>
For the hidden prompters of our speech sometimes<br>
Can use the formulas of a moment’s mood<br>
To weigh unconscious lips with words from Fate:<br>
A casual passing phrase can change our life.<br>
“O spirit, traveller of eternity,<br>
Who cam’st from the immortal spaces here<br>

Armed for the splendid hazard of thy life<br>
To set thy conquering foot on Chance and Time,<br>
The moon shut in her halo dreams like thee.<br>
A mighty Presence still defends thy frame.<br>
Perhaps the heavens guard thee for some great soul,<br>
Thy fate, thy work are kept somewhere afar.<br>
Thy spirit came not down a star alone.<br>
O living inscription of the beauty of love<br>
Missalled in aureate virginity,<br>
What message of heavenly strength and bliss in thee<br>
Is written with the Eternal’s sun-white script,<br>
One shall discover and greaten with it his life<br>
To whom thou loosenest thy heart’s jewelled strings.<br>
O rubies of silence, lips from which there stole<br>
Low laughter, music of tranquillity,<br>
Star-lustrous eyes awake in sweet large night<br>
And limbs like fine-linked poems made of gold<br>
Stanzaed to glimmering curves by artist gods,<br>
Depart where love and destiny call your charm.<br>
Venture through the deep world to find thy mate.<br>
For somewhere on the longing breast of earth,<br>
Thy unknown lover waits for thee the unknown.<br>
Thy soul has strength and needs no other guide<br>
Than One who burns within thy bosom’s powers.<br>
There shall draw near to meet thy approaching steps<br>
The second self for whom thy nature asks,<br>
He who shall walk until thy body’s end<br>
A close-bound traveller pacing with thy pace,<br>
The lyrist of thy soul’s most intimate chords<br>
Who shall give voice to what in thee is mute.<br>
Then shall you grow like vibrant kindred harps,<br>
One in the beats of difference and delight,<br>
Responsive in divine and equal strains,<br>
Discovering new notes of the eternal theme.<br>
One force shall be your mover and your guide,<br>
One light shall be around you and within;<br>

Hand in strong hand confront Heaven’s question, life:<br>
Challenge the ordeal of the immense disguise.<br>
Ascend from Nature to divinity’s heights;<br>
Face the high gods, crowned with felicity,<br>
Then meet a greater god, thy self beyond Time.”<br>
This word was seed of all the thing to be:<br>
A hand from some Greatness opened her heart’s locked doors<br>
And showed the work for which her strength was born.<br>
As when the mantra sinks in Yoga’s ear,<br>
Its message enters stirring the blind brain<br>
And keeps in the dim ignorant cells its sound;<br>
The hearer understands a form of words<br>
And, musing on the index thought it holds,<br>
He strives to read it with the labouring mind,<br>
But finds bright hints, not the embodied truth:<br>
Then, falling silent in himself to know<br>
He meets the deeper listening of his soul:<br>
The Word repeats itself in rhythmic strains:<br>
Thought, vision, feeling, sense, the body’s self<br>
Are seized unutterably and he endures<br>
An ecstasy and an immortal change;<br>
He feels a Wideness and becomes a Power,<br>
All knowledge rushes on him like a sea:<br>
Transmuted by the white spiritual ray<br>
He walks in naked heavens of joy and calm,<br>
Sees the God-face and hears transcendent speech:<br>
An equal greatness in her life was sown.<br>
Accustomed scenes were now an ended play:<br>
Moving in muse amid familiar powers,<br>
Touched by new magnitudes and fiery signs,<br>
She turned to vastnesses not yet her own;<br>
Allured her heart throbbed to unknown sweetnesses;<br>
The secrets of an unseen world were close.<br>
The morn went up into a smiling sky;<br>
Cast from its sapphire pinnacle of trance<br>
Day sank into the burning gold of eve;<br>

The moon floated, a luminous waif through heaven<br>
And sank below the oblivious edge of dream;<br>
Night lit the watch-fires of eternity.<br>
Then all went back into mind’s secret caves;<br>
A darkness stooping on the heaven-bird’s wings<br>
Sealed in her senses from external sight<br>
And opened the stupendous depths of sleep.<br>
When the pale dawn slipped through Night’s shadowy guard,<br>
Vainly the new-born light desired her face;<br>
The palace woke to its own emptiness;<br>
The sovereign of its daily joys was far;<br>
Her moonbeam feet tinged not the lucent floors:<br>
The beauty and divinity were gone.<br>
Delight had fled to search the spacious world.<br>

The Quest<br>
THE WORLD-WAYS opened before Savitri.<br>
At first a strangeness of new brilliant scenes<br>
Peopled her mind and kept her body’s gaze.<br>
But as she moved across the changing earth<br>
A deeper consciousness welled up in her:<br>
A citizen of many scenes and climes,<br>
Each soil and country it had made its home;<br>
It took all clans and peoples for her own,<br>
Till the whole destiny of mankind was hers.<br>
These unfamiliar spaces on her way<br>
Were known and neighbours to a sense within,<br>
Landscapes recurred like lost forgotten fields,<br>
Cities and rivers and plains her vision claimed<br>
Like slow-recurring memories in front,<br>
The stars at night were her past’s brilliant friends,<br>
The winds murmured to her of ancient things<br>
And she met nameless comrades loved by her once.<br>
All was a part of old forgotten selves:<br>
Vaguely or with a flash of sudden hints<br>
Her acts recalled a line of bygone power,<br>
Even her motion’s purpose was not new:<br>
Traveller to a prefigured high event,<br>
She seemed to her remembering witness soul<br>
To trace again a journey often made.<br>
A guidance turned the dumb revolving wheels<br>
And in the eager body of their speed<br>
The dim-masked hooded godheads rode who move<br>
Assigned to man immutably from his birth,<br>
Receivers of the inner and outer law,<br>
At once the agents of his spirit’s will<br>
And witnesses and executors of his fate.<br>
<br>
BOOK IV: The Book of Birth and Quest<br>
<br>
Inexorably faithful to their task,<br>
They hold his nature’s sequence in their guard<br>
Carrying the unbroken thread old lives have spun.<br>
Attendants on his destiny’s measured walk<br>
Leading to joys he has won and pains he has called,<br>
Even in his casual steps they intervene.<br>
Nothing we think or do is void or vain;<br>
Each is an energy loosed and holds its course.<br>
The shadowy keepers of our deathless past<br>
Have made our fate the child of our own acts,<br>
And from the furrows laboured by our will<br>
We reap the fruit of our forgotten deeds.<br>
But since unseen the tree that bore this fruit<br>
And we live in a present born from an unknown past,<br>
They seem but parts of a mechanic Force<br>
To a mechanic mind tied by earth’s laws;<br>
Yet are they instruments of a Will supreme,<br>
Watched by a still all-seeing Eye above.<br>
A prescient architect of Fate and Chance<br>
Who builds our lives on a foreseen design<br>
The meaning knows and consequence of each step<br>
And watches the inferior stumbling powers.<br>
Upon her silent heights she was aware<br>
Of a calm Presence throned above her brows<br>
Who saw the goal and chose each fateful curve;<br>
It used the body for its pedestal;<br>
The eyes that wandered were its searchlight fires,<br>
The hands that held the reins its living tools;<br>
All was the working of an ancient plan,<br>
A way proposed by an unerring Guide.<br>
Across wide noons and glowing afternoons,<br>
She met with Nature and with human forms<br>
And listened to the voices of the world;<br>
Driven from within she followed her long road,<br>
Mute in the luminous cavern of her heart,<br>
Like a bright cloud through the resplendent day.<br>

At first her path ran far through peopled tracts:<br>
Admitted to the lion eye of States<br>
And theatres of the loud act of man,<br>
Her carven chariot with its fretted wheels<br>
Threaded through clamorous marts and sentinel towers<br>
Past figured gates and high dream-sculptured fronts<br>
And gardens hung in the sapphire of the skies,<br>
Pillared assembly halls with armoured guards,<br>
Small fanes where one calm Image watched man’s life<br>
And temples hewn as if by exiled gods<br>
To imitate their lost eternity.<br>
Often from gilded dusk to argent dawn,<br>
Where jewel-lamps flickered on frescoed walls<br>
And the stone lattice stared at moonlit boughs,<br>
Half-conscious of the tardy listening night<br>
Dimly she glided between banks of sleep<br>
At rest in the slumbering palaces of kings.<br>
Hamlet and village saw the fate-wain pass,<br>
Homes of a life bent to the soil it ploughs<br>
For sustenance of its short and passing days<br>
That, transient, keep their old repeated course,<br>
Unchanging in the circle of a sky<br>
Which alters not above our mortal toil.<br>
Away from this thinking creature’s burdened hours<br>
To free and griefless spaces now she turned<br>
Not yet perturbed by human joys and fears.<br>
Here was the childhood of primaeval earth,<br>
Here timeless musings large and glad and still,<br>
Men had forborne as yet to fill with cares,<br>
Imperial acres of the eternal sower<br>
And wind-stirred grass-lands winking in the sun:<br>
Or mid green musing of woods and rough-browed hills,<br>
In the grove’s murmurous bee-air humming wild<br>
Or past the long lapsing voice of silver floods<br>
Like a swift hope journeying among its dreams<br>
Hastened the chariot of the golden bride.<br>

Out of the world’s immense unhuman past<br>
Tract-memories and ageless remnants came,<br>
Domains of light enfeoffed to antique calm<br>
Listened to the unaccustomed sound of hooves<br>
And large immune entangled silences<br>
Absorbed her into emerald secrecy<br>
And slow hushed wizard nets of fiery bloom<br>
Environed with their coloured snare her wheels.<br>
The strong importunate feet of Time fell soft<br>
Along these lonely ways, his titan pace<br>
Forgotten and his stark and ruinous rounds.<br>
The inner ear that listens to solitude,<br>
Leaning self-rapt unboundedly could hear<br>
The rhythm of the intenser wordless Thought<br>
That gathers in the silence behind life,<br>
And the low sweet inarticulate voice of earth<br>
In the great passion of her sun-kissed trance<br>
Ascended with its yearning undertone.<br>
Afar from the brute noise of clamorous needs<br>
The quieted all-seeking mind could feel,<br>
At rest from its blind outwardness of will,<br>
The unwearied clasp of her mute patient love<br>
And know for a soul the mother of our forms.<br>
This spirit stumbling in the fields of sense,<br>
This creature bruised in the mortar of the days<br>
Could find in her broad spaces of release.<br>
Not yet was a world all occupied by care.<br>
The bosom of our mother kept for us still<br>
Her austere regions and her musing depths,<br>
Her impersonal reaches lonely and inspired<br>
And the mightinesses of her rapture haunts.<br>
Muse-lipped she nursed her symbol mysteries<br>
And guarded for her pure-eyed sacraments<br>
The valley clefts between her breasts of joy,<br>
Her mountain altars for the fires of dawn<br>
And nuptial beaches where the ocean couched<br>

And the huge chanting of her prophet woods.<br>
Fields had she of her solitary mirth,<br>
Plains hushed and happy in the embrace of light,<br>
Alone with the cry of birds and hue of flowers,<br>
And wildernesses of wonder lit by her moons<br>
And grey seer-evenings kindling with the stars<br>
And dim movement in the night’s infinitude.<br>
August, exulting in her Maker’s eye,<br>
She felt her nearness to him in earth’s breast,<br>
Conversed still with a Light behind the veil,<br>
Still communed with Eternity beyond.<br>
A few and fit inhabitants she called<br>
To share the glad communion of her peace;<br>
The breadth, the summit were their natural home.<br>
The strong king-sages from their labour done,<br>
Freed from the warrior tension of their task,<br>
Came to her serene sessions in these wilds;<br>
The strife was over, the respite lay in front.<br>
Happy they lived with birds and beasts and flowers<br>
And sunlight and the rustle of the leaves,<br>
And heard the wild winds wandering in the night,<br>
Mused with the stars in their mute constant ranks,<br>
And lodged in the mornings as in azure tents,<br>
And with the glory of the noons were one.<br>
Some deeper plunged; from life’s external clasp<br>
Beckoned into a fiery privacy<br>
In the soul’s unprofaned star-white recess<br>
They sojourned with an everliving Bliss;<br>
A Voice profound in the ecstasy and the hush<br>
They heard, beheld an all-revealing Light.<br>
All time-made difference they overcame;<br>
The world was fibred with their own heart-strings;<br>
Close drawn to the heart that beats in every breast,<br>
They reached the one self in all through boundless love.<br>
Attuned to Silence and to the world-rhyme,<br>
They loosened the knot of the imprisoning mind;<br>

Truth leaned to them from her supernal realm;<br>
Above them blazed eternity’s mystic suns.<br>
Nameless the austere ascetics without home<br>
Abandoning speech and motion and desire<br>
Aloof from creatures sat absorbed, alone,<br>
Immaculate in tranquil heights of self<br>

Young grave disciples fashioned by their touch,<br>
Trained to the simple act and conscious word,<br>
Greatened within and grew to meet their heights.<br>
Far-wandering seekers on the Eternal’s path<br>
Brought to these quiet founts their spirit’s thirst<br>
And spent the treasure of a silent hour<br>
Bathed in the purity of the mild gaze<br>
That, uninsistent, ruled them from its peace,<br>
And by its influence found the ways of calm.<br>
The Infants of the monarchy of the worlds,<br>
The heroic leaders of a coming time,<br>

She rested drawing round her like a cloak<br>
Its spirit of patient muse and potent prayer.<br>
Or near to a lion river’s tawny mane<br>
And trees that worshipped on a praying shore,<br>
A domed and templed air’s serene repose<br>

Thence to great solitary tracts she came,<br>
Where man was a passer-by towards human scenes<br>
Or sole in Nature’s vastness strove to live<br>
And called for help to ensouled invisible Powers,<br>
Overwhelmed by the immensity of his world<br>
And unaware of his own infinity.<br>

And called her with a far and nameless voice.<br>

The forests with their multitudinous chant<br>
Disclosed to her the masked divinity’s doors.<br>
On dreaming plains, an indolent expanse,<br>
The death-bed of a pale enchanted eve<br>
Under the glamour of a sunken sky,<br>
Impassive she lay as at an age’s end,<br>

Lifting their heads to hunt a lairlike sky,<br>
Or travelled in a strange and empty land<br>
Where desolate summits camped in a weird heaven,<br>
Mute sentinels beneath a drifting moon,<br>
Or wandered in some lone tremendous wood<br>
Ringing for ever with the crickets’ cry<br>
Or followed a long glistening serpent road<br>
Through fields and pastures lapped in moveless light<br>
Or reached the wild beauty of a desert space<br>
Where never plough was driven nor herd had grazed<br>
And slumbered upon stripped and thirsty sands<br>
Amid the savage wild-beast night’s appeal.<br>
Still unaccomplished was the fateful quest;<br>

Our acts interpret an omniscient Force<br>
That dwells in the compelling stuff of things,<br>
And nothing happens in the cosmic play<br>
But at its time and in its foreseen place.<br>
To a space she came of soft and delicate air<br>
That seemed a sanctuary of youth and joy,<br>
A highland world of free and green delight<br>
Where spring and summer lay together and strove<br>
In indolent and amicable debate,<br>
Inarmed, disputing with laughter who should rule.<br>
There expectation beat wide sudden wings<br>
As if a soul had looked out from earth’s face,<br>
And all that was in her felt a coming change<br>
And forgetting obvious joys and common dreams,<br>
Obedient to Time’s call, to the spirit’s fate,<br>
Was lifted to a beauty calm and pure<br>
That lived under the eyes of Eternity.<br>
A crowd of mountainous heads assailed the sky<br>
Pushing towards rival shoulders nearer heaven,<br>
The armoured leaders of an iron line;<br>
Earth prostrate lay beneath their feet of stone.<br>
Below them crouched a dream of emerald woods<br>
And gleaming borders solitary as sleep:<br>
Pale waters ran like glimmering threads of pearl.<br>

Cool-perfumed with slow pleasure-burdened feet<br>
Faint stumbling breezes faltered among flowers.<br>

She squandered the love-music of her notes,<br>
Wasting the passionate pattern of her blooms<br>
And festival riot of her scents and hues.<br>

<br>
Satyavan<br>
ALL SHE remembered on this day of Fate,<br>
The road that hazarded not the solemn depths<br>
But turned away to flee to human homes,<br>
The wilderness with its mighty monotone,<br>
The morning like a lustrous seer above,<br>
The passion of the summits lost in heaven,<br>
The titan murmur of the endless woods.<br>
As if a wicket gate to joy were there<br>
Ringed in with voiceless hint and magic sign,<br>
Upon the margin of an unknown world<br>
Reclined the curve of a sun-held recess;<br>
Groves with strange flowers like eyes of gazing nymphs<br>
Peered from their secrecy into open space,<br>
Boughs whispering to a constancy of light<br>
Sheltered a dim and screened felicity,<br>
And slowly a supine inconstant breeze<br>
Ran like a fleeting sigh of happiness<br>
Over slumbrous grasses pranked with green and gold.<br>
Hidden in the forest’s bosom of loneliness<br>
Amid the leaves the inmate voices called,<br>
Sweet like desires enamoured and unseen,<br>
Cry answering to low insistent cry.<br>
Behind slept emerald dumb remotenesses,<br>
Haunt of a Nature passionate, veiled, denied<br>
To all but her own vision lost and wild.<br>
Earth in this beautiful refuge free from cares<br>
Murmured to the soul a song of strength and peace.<br>
Only one sign was there of a human tread:<br>
A single path, shot thin and arrowlike<br>
Into this bosom of vast and secret life,<br>
Pierced its enormous dream of solitude.<br>
<br>
CANTO II: Satyavan<br>
<br>
Here first she met on the uncertain earth<br>
The one for whom her heart had come so far.<br>
As might a soul on Nature’s background limned<br>
Stand out for a moment in a house of dream<br>
Created by the ardent breath of life,<br>
So he appeared against the forest verge<br>
Inset twixt green relief and golden ray.<br>
As if a weapon of the living Light,<br>
Erect and lofty like a spear of God<br>
His figure led the splendour of the morn.<br>
Noble and clear as the broad peaceful heavens<br>
A tablet of young wisdom was his brow;<br>
Freedom’s imperious beauty curved his limbs,<br>
The joy of life was on his open face.<br>
His look was a wide daybreak of the gods,<br>
His head was a youthful Rishi’s touched with light,<br>
His body was a lover’s and a king’s.<br>
In the magnificent dawning of his force<br>
Built like a moving statue of delight<br>
He illumined the border of the forest page.<br>
Out of the ignorant eager toil of the years<br>
Abandoning man’s loud drama he had come<br>
Led by the wisdom of an adverse Fate<br>
To meet the ancient Mother in her groves.<br>
In her divine communion he had grown<br>
A foster-child of beauty and solitude,<br>
Heir to the centuries of the lonely wise,<br>
A brother of the sunshine and the sky,<br>
A wanderer communing with depth and marge.<br>
A Veda-knower of the unwritten book<br>
Perusing the mystic scripture of her forms,<br>
He had caught her hierophant significances,<br>
Her sphered immense imaginations learned,<br>
Taught by sublimities of stream and wood<br>
And voices of the sun and star and flame<br>
And chant of the magic singers on the boughs<br>
<br>
393<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
And the dumb teaching of four-footed things.<br>
Helping with confident steps her slow great hands<br>
He leaned to her influence like a flower to rain<br>
And, like the flower and tree a natural growth,<br>
Widened with the touches of her shaping hours.<br>
The mastery free natures have was his<br>
And their assent to joy and spacious calm;<br>
One with the single Spirit inhabiting all,<br>
He laid experience at the Godhead’s feet;<br>
His mind was open to her infinite mind,<br>
His acts were rhythmic with her primal force;<br>
He had subdued his mortal thought to hers.<br>
That day he had turned from his accustomed paths;<br>
For One who, knowing every moment’s load,<br>
Can move in all our studied or careless steps,<br>
Had laid the spell of destiny on his feet<br>
And drawn him to the forest’s flowering verge.<br>
At first her glance that took life’s million shapes<br>
Impartially to people its treasure-house<br>
Along with sky and flower and hill and star,<br>
Dwelt rather on the bright harmonious scene.<br>
It saw the green-gold of the slumbrous sward,<br>
The grasses quivering with the slow wind’s tread,<br>
The branches haunted by the wild bird’s call.<br>
Awake to Nature, vague as yet to life,<br>
The eager prisoner from the Infinite,<br>
The immortal wrestler in its mortal house,<br>
Its pride, power, passion of a striving God,<br>
It saw this image of veiled deity,<br>
This thinking master creature of the earth,<br>
This last result of the beauty of the stars,<br>
But only saw like fair and common forms<br>
The artist spirit needs not for its work<br>
And puts aside in memory’s shadowy rooms.<br>
A look, a turn decides our ill-poised fate.<br>
Thus in the hour that most concerned her all,<br>
<br>
394<br>
<br>
CANTO II: Satyavan<br>
<br>
Wandering unwarned by the slow surface mind,<br>
The heedless scout beneath her tenting lids<br>
Admired indifferent beauty and cared not<br>
To wake her body’s spirit to its king.<br>
So might she have passed by on chance ignorant roads<br>
Missing the call of Heaven, losing life’s aim,<br>
But the god touched in time her conscious soul.<br>
Her vision settled, caught and all was changed.<br>
Her mind at first dwelt in ideal dreams,<br>
Those intimate transmuters of earth’s signs<br>
That make known things a hint of unseen spheres,<br>
And saw in him the genius of the spot,<br>
A symbol figure standing mid earth’s scenes,<br>
A king of life outlined in delicate air.<br>
Yet this was but a moment’s reverie;<br>
For suddenly her heart looked out at him,<br>
The passionate seeing used thought cannot match,<br>
And knew one nearer than its own close strings.<br>
All in a moment was surprised and seized,<br>
All in inconscient ecstasy lain wrapped<br>
Or under imagination’s coloured lids<br>
Held up in a large mirror-air of dream,<br>
Broke forth in flame to recreate the world,<br>
And in that flame to new things she was born.<br>
A mystic tumult from her depths arose;<br>
Haled, smitten erect like one who dreamed at ease,<br>
Life ran to gaze from every gate of sense:<br>
Thoughts indistinct and glad in moon-mist heavens,<br>
Feelings as when a universe takes birth,<br>
Swept through the turmoil of her bosom’s space<br>
Invaded by a swarm of golden gods:<br>
Arising to a hymn of wonder’s priests<br>
Her soul flung wide its doors to this new sun.<br>
An alchemy worked, the transmutation came;<br>
The missioned face had wrought the Master’s spell.<br>
In the nameless light of two approaching eyes<br>
<br>
395<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
A swift and fated turning of her days<br>
Appeared and stretched to a gleam of unknown worlds.<br>
Then trembling with the mystic shock her heart<br>
Moved in her breast and cried out like a bird<br>
Who hears his mate upon a neighbouring bough.<br>
Hooves trampling fast, wheels largely stumbling ceased;<br>
The chariot stood like an arrested wind.<br>
And Satyavan looked out from his soul’s doors<br>
And felt the enchantment of her liquid voice<br>
Fill his youth’s purple ambience and endured<br>
The haunting miracle of a perfect face.<br>
Mastered by the honey of a strange flower-mouth,<br>
Drawn to soul-spaces opening round a brow,<br>
He turned to the vision like a sea to the moon<br>
And suffered a dream of beauty and of change,<br>
Discovered the aureole round a mortal’s head,<br>
Adored a new divinity in things.<br>
His self-bound nature foundered as in fire;<br>
His life was taken into another’s life.<br>
The splendid lonely idols of his brain<br>
Fell prostrate from their bright sufficiencies,<br>
As at the touch of a new infinite,<br>
To worship a godhead greater than their own.<br>
An unknown imperious force drew him to her.<br>
Marvelling he came across the golden sward:<br>
Gaze met close gaze and clung in sight’s embrace.<br>
A visage was there, noble and great and calm,<br>
As if encircled by a halo of thought,<br>
A span, an arch of meditating light,<br>
As though some secret nimbus half was seen;<br>
Her inner vision still remembering knew<br>
A forehead that wore the crown of all her past,<br>
Two eyes her constant and eternal stars,<br>
Comrade and sovereign eyes that claimed her soul,<br>
Lids known through many lives, large frames of love.<br>
He met in her regard his future’s gaze,<br>
<br>
396<br>
<br>
CANTO II: Satyavan<br>
<br>
A promise and a presence and a fire,<br>
Saw an embodiment of aeonic dreams,<br>
A mystery of the rapture for which all<br>
Yearns in this world of brief mortality<br>
Made in material shape his very own.<br>
This golden figure given to his grasp<br>
Hid in its breast the key of all his aims,<br>
A spell to bring the Immortal’s bliss on earth,<br>
To mate with heaven’s truth our mortal thought,<br>
To lift earth-hearts nearer the Eternal’s sun.<br>
In these great spirits now incarnate here<br>
Love brought down power out of eternity<br>
To make of life his new undying base.<br>
His passion surged a wave from fathomless deeps;<br>
It leaped to earth from far forgotten heights,<br>
But kept its nature of infinity.<br>
On the dumb bosom of this oblivious globe<br>
Although as unknown beings we seem to meet,<br>
Our lives are not aliens nor as strangers join,<br>
Moved to each other by a causeless force.<br>
The soul can recognise its answering soul<br>
Across dividing Time and, on life’s roads<br>
Absorbed wrapped traveller, turning it recovers<br>
Familiar splendours in an unknown face<br>
And touched by the warning finger of swift love<br>
It thrills again to an immortal joy<br>
Wearing a mortal body for delight.<br>
There is a Power within that knows beyond<br>
Our knowings; we are greater than our thoughts,<br>
And sometimes earth unveils that vision here.<br>
To live, to love are signs of infinite things,<br>
Love is a glory from eternity’s spheres.<br>
Abased, disfigured, mocked by baser mights<br>
That steal his name and shape and ecstasy,<br>
He is still the godhead by which all can change.<br>
A mystery wakes in our inconscient stuff,<br>
<br>
397<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
A bliss is born that can remake our life.<br>
Love dwells in us like an unopened flower<br>
Awaiting a rapid moment of the soul,<br>
Or he roams in his charmed sleep mid thoughts and things;<br>
The child-god is at play, he seeks himself<br>
In many hearts and minds and living forms:<br>
He lingers for a sign that he can know<br>
And, when it comes, wakes blindly to a voice,<br>
A look, a touch, the meaning of a face.<br>
His instrument the dim corporeal mind,<br>
Of celestial insight now forgetful grown,<br>
He seizes on some sign of outward charm<br>
To guide him mid the throng of Nature’s hints,<br>
Reads heavenly truths into earth’s semblances,<br>
Desires the image for the godhead’s sake,<br>
Divines the immortalities of form<br>
And takes the body for the sculptured soul.<br>
Love’s adoration like a mystic seer<br>
Through vision looks at the invisible,<br>
In earth’s alphabet finds a godlike sense;<br>
But the mind only thinks, “Behold the one<br>
For whom my life has waited long unfilled,<br>
Behold the sudden sovereign of my days.”<br>
Heart feels for heart, limb cries for answering limb;<br>
All strives to enforce the unity all is.<br>
Too far from the Divine, Love seeks his truth<br>
And Life is blind and the instruments deceive<br>
And Powers are there that labour to debase.<br>
Still can the vision come, the joy arrive.<br>
Rare is the cup fit for love’s nectar wine,<br>
As rare the vessel that can hold God’s birth;<br>
A soul made ready through a thousand years<br>
Is the living mould of a supreme Descent.<br>
These knew each other though in forms thus strange.<br>
Although to sight unknown, though life and mind<br>
Had altered to hold a new significance,<br>
<br>
398<br>
<br>
CANTO II: Satyavan<br>
<br>
399<br>
<br>
These bodies summed the drift of numberless births,<br>
And the spirit to the spirit was the same.<br>
Amazed by a joy for which they had waited long,<br>
The lovers met upon their different paths,<br>
Travellers across the limitless plains of Time<br>
Together drawn from fate-led journeyings<br>
In the self-closed solitude of their human past,<br>
To a swift rapturous dream of future joy<br>
And the unexpected present of these eyes.<br>
By the revealing greatness of a look,<br>
Form-smitten the spirit’s memory woke in sense.<br>
The mist was torn that lay between two lives;<br>
Her heart unveiled and his to find her turned;<br>
Attracted as in heaven star by star,<br>
They wondered at each other and rejoiced<br>
And wove affinity in a silent gaze.<br>
A moment passed that was eternity’s ray,<br>
An hour began, the matrix of new Time.<br>
END OF CANTO TWO<br>
<br>
Canto Three<br>
<br>
Satyavan and Savitri<br>
OUT OF the voiceless mystery of the past<br>
In a present ignorant of forgotten bonds<br>
These spirits met upon the roads of Time.<br>
Yet in the heart their secret conscious selves<br>
At once aware grew of each other warned<br>
By the first call of a delightful voice<br>
And a first vision of the destined face.<br>
As when being cries to being from its depths<br>
Behind the screen of the external sense<br>
And strives to find the heart-disclosing word,<br>
The passionate speech revealing the soul’s need,<br>
But the mind’s ignorance veils the inner sight,<br>
Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds,<br>
So now they met in that momentous hour,<br>
So utter the recognition in the deeps,<br>
The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed.<br>
Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri:<br>
“O thou who com’st to me out of Time’s silences,<br>
Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss,<br>
Immortal or mortal only in thy frame,<br>
For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul<br>
And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze,<br>
How art thou named among the sons of men?<br>
Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit’s days,<br>
Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers,<br>
Into the lonely borders of my life,<br>
O sunlight moulded like a golden maid?<br>
I know that mighty gods are friends of earth.<br>
Amid the pageantries of day and dusk,<br>
Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul<br>
Moved by the marvel of familiar things.<br>
<br>
CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
Earth could not hide from me the powers she veils:<br>
Even though moving mid an earthly scene<br>
And the common surfaces of terrestrial things,<br>
My vision saw unblinded by her forms;<br>
The Godhead looked at me from familiar scenes.<br>
I witnessed the virgin bridals of the dawn<br>
Behind the glowing curtains of the sky<br>
Or vying in joy with the bright morning’s steps<br>
I paced along the slumbrous coasts of noon,<br>
Or the gold desert of the sunlight crossed<br>
Traversing great wastes of splendour and of fire,<br>
Or met the moon gliding amazed through heaven<br>
In the uncertain wideness of the night,<br>
Or the stars marched on their long sentinel routes<br>
Pointing their spears through the infinitudes:<br>
The day and dusk revealed to me hidden shapes;<br>
Figures have come to me from secret shores<br>
And happy faces looked from ray and flame.<br>
I have heard strange voices cross the ether’s waves,<br>
The Centaur’s wizard song has thrilled my ear;<br>
I have glimpsed the Apsaras bathing in the pools,<br>
I have seen the wood-nymphs peering through the leaves;<br>
The winds have shown to me their trampling lords,<br>
I have beheld the princes of the Sun<br>
Burning in thousand-pillared homes of light.<br>
So now my mind could dream and my heart fear<br>
That from some wonder-couch beyond our air<br>
Risen in a wide morning of the gods<br>
Thou drov’st thy horses from the Thunderer’s worlds.<br>
Although to heaven thy beauty seems allied,<br>
Much rather would my thoughts rejoice to know<br>
That mortal sweetness smiles between thy lids<br>
And thy heart can beat beneath a human gaze<br>
And thy aureate bosom quiver with a look<br>
And its tumult answer to an earth-born voice.<br>
If our time-vexed affections thou canst feel,<br>
<br>
401<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
Earth’s ease of simple things can satisfy,<br>
If thy glance can dwell content on earthly soil,<br>
And this celestial summary of delight,<br>
Thy golden body, dally with fatigue<br>
Oppressing with its grace our terrain, while<br>
The frail sweet passing taste of earthly food<br>
Delays thee and the torrent’s leaping wine,<br>
Descend. Let thy journey cease, come down to us.<br>
Close is my father’s creepered hermitage<br>
Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings,<br>
Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs<br>
Whose chants repeat transcribed in music’s notes<br>
The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs<br>
And fill the hours with their melodious cry.<br>
Amid the welcome-hum of many bees<br>
Invade our honied kingdom of the woods;<br>
There let me lead thee into an opulent life.<br>
Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life;<br>
Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth.<br>
Wild winds run — visitors midst the swaying tops,<br>
Through the calm days heaven’s sentinels of peace<br>
Couched on a purple robe of sky above<br>
Look down on a rich secrecy and hush<br>
And the chambered nuptial waters chant within.<br>
Enormous, whispering, many-formed around<br>
High forest gods have taken in their arms<br>
The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps.<br>
Apparelled are the morns in gold and green,<br>
Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls<br>
To make a resting chamber fit for thee.”<br>
Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice,<br>
Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke.<br>
Musing she answered, “I am Savitri,<br>
Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name<br>
Musical on earth expresses thee to men?<br>
What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams<br>
<br>
402<br>
<br>
CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
Has flowered at last upon one happy branch?<br>
Why is thy dwelling in the pathless wood<br>
Far from the deeds thy glorious youth demands,<br>
Haunt of the anchorites and earth’s wilder broods,<br>
Where only with thy witness self thou roamst<br>
In Nature’s green unhuman loneliness<br>
Surrounded by enormous silences<br>
And the blind murmur of primaeval calms?”<br>
And Satyavan replied to Savitri:<br>
“In days when yet his sight looked clear on life,<br>
King Dyumatsena once, the Shalwa, reigned<br>
Through all the tract which from behind these tops<br>
Passing its days of emerald delight<br>
In trusting converse with the traveller winds<br>
Turns, looking back towards the southern heavens,<br>
And leans its flank upon the musing hills.<br>
But equal Fate removed her covering hand.<br>
A living night enclosed the strong man’s paths,<br>
Heaven’s brilliant gods recalled their careless gifts,<br>
Took from blank eyes their glad and helping ray<br>
And led the uncertain goddess from his side.<br>
Outcast from empire of the outer light,<br>
Lost to the comradeship of seeing men,<br>
He sojourns in two solitudes, within<br>
And in the solemn rustle of the woods.<br>
Son of that king, I, Satyavan, have lived<br>
Contented, for not yet of thee aware,<br>
In my high-peopled loneliness of spirit<br>
And this huge vital murmur kin to me,<br>
Nursed by the vastness, pupil of solitude.<br>
Great Nature came to her recovered child;<br>
I reigned in a kingdom of a nobler kind<br>
Than men can build upon dull Matter’s soil;<br>
I met the frankness of the primal earth,<br>
I enjoyed the intimacy of infant God.<br>
In the great tapestried chambers of her state,<br>
<br>
403<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
Free in her boundless palace I have dwelt<br>
Indulged by the warm mother of us all,<br>
Reared with my natural brothers in her house.<br>
I lay in the wide bare embrace of heaven,<br>
The sunlight’s radiant blessing clasped my brow,<br>
The moonbeams’ silver ecstasy at night<br>
Kissed my dim lids to sleep. Earth’s morns were mine;<br>
Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours<br>
I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice<br>
Of winds and waters, partner of the sun’s joy,<br>
A listener to the universal speech:<br>
My spirit satisfied within me knew<br>
Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life<br>
Whose close belongings are the earth and skies.<br>
Before Fate led me into this emerald world,<br>
Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within,<br>
An early prescience in my mind approached<br>
The great dumb animal consciousness of earth<br>
Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps<br>
To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast.<br>
Already I met her in my spirit’s dream.<br>
As if to a deeper country of the soul<br>
Transposing the vivid imagery of earth,<br>
Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came.<br>
A visioned spell pursued my boyhood’s hours,<br>
All things the eye had caught in coloured lines<br>
Were seen anew through the interpreting mind<br>
And in the shape it sought to seize the soul.<br>
An early child-god took my hand that held,<br>
Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch,<br>
Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight;<br>
Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men.<br>
High beauty’s visitants my intimates were.<br>
The neighing pride of rapid life that roams<br>
Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood<br>
Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer<br>
<br>
404<br>
<br>
CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
Against the vesper sky became a song<br>
Of evening to the silence of my soul.<br>
I caught for some eternal eye the sudden<br>
King-fisher flashing to a darkling pool;<br>
A slow swan silvering the azure lake,<br>
A shape of magic whiteness, sailed through dream;<br>
Leaves trembling with the passion of the wind,<br>
Pranked butterflies, the conscious flowers of air,<br>
And wandering wings in blue infinity<br>
Lived on the tablets of my inner sight;<br>
Mountains and trees stood there like thoughts from God.<br>
The brilliant long-bills in their vivid dress,<br>
The peacock scattering on the breeze his moons<br>
Painted my memory like a frescoed wall.<br>
I carved my vision out of wood and stone;<br>
I caught the echoes of a word supreme<br>
And metred the rhythm-beats of infinity<br>
And listened through music for the eternal Voice.<br>
I felt a covert touch, I heard a call,<br>
But could not clasp the body of my God<br>
Or hold between my hands the World-Mother’s feet.<br>
In men I met strange portions of a Self<br>
That sought for fragments and in fragments lived:<br>
Each lived in himself and for himself alone<br>
And with the rest joined only fleeting ties;<br>
Each passioned over his surface joy and grief,<br>
Nor saw the Eternal in his secret house.<br>
I conversed with Nature, mused with the changeless stars,<br>
God’s watch-fires burning in the ignorant Night,<br>
And saw upon her mighty visage fall<br>
A ray prophetic of the Eternal’s sun.<br>
I sat with the forest sages in their trance:<br>
There poured awakening streams of diamond light,<br>
I glimpsed the presence of the One in all.<br>
But still there lacked the last transcendent power<br>
And Matter still slept empty of its Lord.<br>
<br>
405<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
The Spirit was saved, the body lost and mute<br>
Lived still with Death and ancient Ignorance;<br>
The Inconscient was its base, the Void its fate.<br>
But thou hast come and all will surely change:<br>
I shall feel the World-Mother in thy golden limbs<br>
And hear her wisdom in thy sacred voice.<br>
The child of the Void shall be reborn in God,<br>
My Matter shall evade the Inconscient’s trance.<br>
My body like my spirit shall be free.<br>
It shall escape from Death and Ignorance.”<br>
And Savitri, musing still, replied to him:<br>
“Speak more to me, speak more, O Satyavan,<br>
Speak of thyself and all thou art within;<br>
I would know thee as if we had ever lived<br>
Together in the chamber of our souls.<br>
Speak till a light shall come into my heart<br>
And my moved mortal mind shall understand<br>
What all the deathless being in me feels.<br>
It knows that thou art he my spirit has sought<br>
Amidst earth’s thronging visages and forms<br>
Across the golden spaces of my life.”<br>
And Satyavan like a replying harp<br>
To the insistent calling of a flute<br>
Answered her questioning and let stream to her<br>
His heart in many-coloured waves of speech:<br>
“O golden princess, perfect Savitri,<br>
More I would tell than failing words can speak,<br>
Of all that thou hast meant to me, unknown,<br>
All that the lightning-flash of love reveals<br>
In one great hour of the unveiling gods.<br>
Even a brief nearness has reshaped my life.<br>
For now I know that all I lived and was<br>
Moved towards this moment of my heart’s rebirth;<br>
I look back on the meaning of myself,<br>
A soul made ready on earth’s soil for thee.<br>
Once were my days like days of other men:<br>
<br>
406<br>
<br>
CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
To think and act was all, to enjoy and breathe;<br>
This was the width and height of mortal hope:<br>
Yet there came glimpses of a deeper self<br>
That lives behind Life and makes her act its scene.<br>
A truth was felt that screened its shape from mind,<br>
A Greatness working towards a hidden end,<br>
And vaguely through the forms of earth there looked<br>
Something that life is not and yet must be.<br>
I groped for the Mystery with the lantern, Thought.<br>
Its glimmerings lighted with the abstract word<br>
A half-visible ground and travelling yard by yard<br>
It mapped a system of the Self and God.<br>
I could not live the truth it spoke and thought.<br>
I turned to seize its form in visible things,<br>
Hoping to fix its rule by mortal mind,<br>
Imposed a narrow structure of world-law<br>
Upon the freedom of the Infinite,<br>
A hard firm skeleton of outward Truth,<br>
A mental scheme of a mechanic Power.<br>
This light showed more the darknesses unsearched;<br>
It made the original Secrecy more occult;<br>
It could not analyse its cosmic Veil<br>
Or glimpse the Wonder-worker’s hidden hand<br>
And trace the pattern of his magic plans.<br>
I plunged into an inner seeing Mind<br>
And knew the secret laws and sorceries<br>
That make of Matter mind’s bewildered slave:<br>
The mystery was not solved but deepened more.<br>
I strove to find its hints through Beauty and Art,<br>
But Form cannot unveil the indwelling Power;<br>
Only it throws its symbols at our hearts.<br>
It evoked a mood of self, invoked a sign<br>
Of all the brooding glory hidden in sense:<br>
I lived in the ray but faced not to the sun.<br>
I looked upon the world and missed the Self,<br>
And when I found the Self, I lost the world,<br>
<br>
407<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
My other selves I lost and the body of God,<br>
The link of the finite with the Infinite,<br>
The bridge between the appearance and the Truth,<br>
The mystic aim for which the world was made,<br>
The human sense of Immortality.<br>
But now the gold link comes to me with thy feet<br>
And His gold sun has shone on me from thy face.<br>
For now another realm draws near with thee<br>
And now diviner voices fill my ear,<br>
A strange new world swims to me in thy gaze<br>
Approaching like a star from unknown heavens;<br>
A cry of spheres comes with thee and a song<br>
Of flaming gods. I draw a wealthier breath<br>
And in a fierier march of moments move.<br>
My mind transfigures to a rapturous seer.<br>
A foam-leap travelling from the waves of bliss<br>
Has changed my heart and changed the earth around:<br>
All with thy coming fills. Air, soil and stream<br>
Wear bridal raiment to be fit for thee<br>
And sunlight grows a shadow of thy hue<br>
Because of change within me by thy look.<br>
Come nearer to me from thy car of light<br>
On this green sward disdaining not our soil.<br>
For here are secret spaces made for thee<br>
Whose caves of emerald long to screen thy form.<br>
Wilt thou not make this mortal bliss thy sphere?<br>
Descend, O happiness, with thy moon-gold feet<br>
Enrich earth’s floors upon whose sleep we lie.<br>
O my bright beauty’s princess Savitri,<br>
By my delight and thy own joy compelled<br>
Enter my life, thy chamber and thy shrine.<br>
In the great quietness where spirits meet,<br>
Led by my hushed desire into my woods<br>
Let the dim rustling arches over thee lean;<br>
One with the breath of things eternal live,<br>
Thy heart-beats near to mine, till there shall leap<br>
<br>

CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
Enchanted from the fragrance of the flowers<br>
A moment which all murmurs shall recall<br>
And every bird remember in its cry.”<br>
Allured to her lashes by his passionate words<br>
Her fathomless soul looked out at him from her eyes;<br>
Passing her lips in liquid sounds it spoke.<br>
This word alone she uttered and said all:<br>
“O Satyavan, I have heard thee and I know;<br>
I know that thou and only thou art he.”<br>
Then down she came from her high carven car<br>
Descending with a soft and faltering haste;<br>
Her many-hued raiment glistening in the light<br>
Hovered a moment over the wind-stirred grass,<br>
Mixed with a glimmer of her body’s ray<br>
Like lovely plumage of a settling bird.<br>
Her gleaming feet upon the green-gold sward<br>
Scattered a memory of wandering beams<br>
And lightly pressed the unspoken desire of earth<br>
Cherished in her too brief passing by the soil.<br>
Then flitting like pale-brilliant moths her hands<br>
Took from the sylvan verge’s sunlit arms<br>
A load of their jewel-faces’ clustering swarms,<br>
Companions of the spring-time and the breeze.<br>
A candid garland set with simple forms<br>
Her rapid fingers taught a flower song,<br>
The stanzaed movement of a marriage hymn.<br>
Profound in perfume and immersed in hue<br>
They mixed their yearning’s coloured signs and made<br>
The bloom of their purity and passion one.<br>
A sacrament of joy in treasuring palms<br>
She brought, flower-symbol of her offered life,<br>
Then with raised hands that trembled a little now<br>
At the very closeness that her soul desired,<br>
This bond of sweetness, their bright union’s sign,<br>
She laid on the bosom coveted by her love.<br>
<br>
409<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
As if inclined before some gracious god<br>
Who has out of his mist of greatness shone<br>
To fill with beauty his adorer’s hours,<br>
She bowed and touched his feet with worshipping hands;<br>
She made her life his world for him to tread<br>
And made her body the room of his delight,<br>
Her beating heart a remembrancer of bliss.<br>
He bent to her and took into his own<br>
Their married yearning joined like folded hopes;<br>
As if a whole rich world suddenly possessed,<br>
Wedded to all he had been, became himself,<br>
An inexhaustible joy made his alone,<br>
He gathered all Savitri into his clasp.<br>
Around her his embrace became the sign<br>
Of a locked closeness through slow intimate years,<br>
A first sweet summary of delight to come,<br>
One brevity intense of all long life.<br>
In a wide moment of two souls that meet<br>
She felt her being flow into him as in waves<br>
A river pours into a mighty sea.<br>
As when a soul is merging into God<br>
To live in Him for ever and know His joy,<br>
Her consciousness grew aware of him alone<br>
And all her separate self was lost in his.<br>
As a starry heaven encircles happy earth,<br>
He shut her into himself in a circle of bliss<br>
And shut the world into himself and her.<br>
A boundless isolation made them one;<br>
He was aware of her enveloping him<br>
And let her penetrate his very soul<br>
As is a world by the world’s spirit filled,<br>
As the mortal wakes into Eternity,<br>
As the finite opens to the Infinite.<br>
Thus were they in each other lost awhile,<br>
Then drawing back from their long ecstasy’s trance<br>
Came into a new self and a new world.<br>
<br>
410<br>
<br>
CANTO III: Satyavan and Savitri<br>
<br>
Each now was a part of the other’s unity,<br>
The world was but their twin self-finding’s scene<br>
Or their own wedded being’s vaster frame.<br>
On the high glowing cupola of the day<br>
Fate tied a knot with morning’s halo threads<br>
While by the ministry of an auspice-hour<br>
Heart-bound before the sun, their marriage fire,<br>
The wedding of the eternal Lord and Spouse<br>
Took place again on earth in human forms:<br>
In a new act of the drama of the world<br>
The united Two began a greater age.<br>
In the silence and murmur of that emerald world<br>
And the mutter of the priest-wind’s sacred verse,<br>
Amid the choral whispering of the leaves<br>
Love’s twain had joined together and grew one.<br>
The natural miracle was wrought once more:<br>
In the immutable ideal world<br>
One human moment was eternal made.<br>
Then down the narrow path where their lives had met<br>
He led and showed to her her future world,<br>
Love’s refuge and corner of happy solitude.<br>
At the path’s end through a green cleft in the trees<br>
She saw a clustering line of hermit-roofs<br>
And looked now first on her heart’s future home,<br>
The thatch that covered the life of Satyavan.<br>
Adorned with creepers and red climbing flowers<br>
It seemed a sylvan beauty in her dreams<br>
Slumbering with brown body and tumbled hair<br>
In her chamber inviolate of emerald peace.<br>
Around it stretched the forest’s anchorite mood<br>
Lost in the depths of its own solitude.<br>
Then moved by the deep joy she could not speak,<br>
A little depth of it quivering in her words,<br>
Her happy voice cried out to Satyavan:<br>
“My heart will stay here on this forest verge<br>
<br>
411<br>
<br>
BOOK V: The Book of Love<br>
<br>
412<br>
<br>
And close to this thatched roof while I am far:<br>
Now of more wandering it has no need.<br>
But I must haste back to my father’s house<br>
Which soon will lose one loved accustomed tread<br>
And listen in vain for a once cherished voice.<br>
For soon I shall return nor ever again<br>
Oneness must sever its recovered bliss<br>
Or fate sunder our lives while life is ours.”<br>
Once more she mounted on the carven car<br>
And under the ardour of a fiery noon<br>
Less bright than the splendour of her thoughts and dreams<br>
She sped swift-reined, swift-hearted but still saw<br>
In still lucidities of sight’s inner world<br>
Through the cool-scented wood’s luxurious gloom<br>
On shadowy paths between great rugged trunks<br>
Pace towards a tranquil clearing Satyavan.<br>
A nave of trees enshrined the hermit thatch,<br>
The new deep covert of her felicity,<br>
Preferred to heaven her soul’s temple and home.<br>
This now remained with her, her heart’s constant scene.<br>

<br>
The Word of Fate<br>
IN SILENT bounds bordering the mortal’s plane<br>
Crossing a wide expanse of brilliant peace<br>
Narad the heavenly sage from Paradise<br>
Came chanting through the large and lustrous air.<br>
Attracted by the golden summer-earth<br>
That lay beneath him like a glowing bowl<br>
Tilted upon a table of the Gods,<br>
Turning as if moved round by an unseen hand<br>
To catch the warmth and blaze of a small sun,<br>
He passed from the immortals’ happy paths<br>
To a world of toil and quest and grief and hope,<br>
To these rooms of the see-saw game of death with life.<br>
Across an intangible border of soul-space<br>
He passed from Mind into material things<br>
Amid the inventions of the inconscient Self<br>
And the workings of a blind somnambulist Force.<br>
Below him circling burned the myriad suns:<br>
He bore the ripples of the etheric sea;<br>
A primal Air brought the first joy of touch;<br>
A secret Spirit drew its mighty breath<br>
Contracting and expanding this huge world<br>
In its formidable circuit through the Void;<br>
The secret might of the creative Fire<br>
Displayed its triple power to build and form,<br>
Its infinitesimal wave-sparks’ weaving dance,<br>
Its nebulous units grounding shape and mass,<br>
Magic foundation and pattern of a world,<br>
Its radiance bursting into the light of stars;<br>
He felt a sap of life, a sap of death;<br>
Into solid Matter’s dense communion<br>
Plunging and its obscure oneness of forms<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
He shared with a dumb Spirit identity.<br>
He beheld the cosmic Being at his task,<br>
His eyes measured the spaces, gauged the depths,<br>
His inner gaze the movements of the soul,<br>
He saw the eternal labour of the Gods,<br>
And looked upon the life of beasts and men.<br>
A change now fell upon the singer’s mood,<br>
A rapture and a pathos moved his voice;<br>
He sang no more of Light that never wanes,<br>
And oneness and pure everlasting bliss,<br>
He sang no more the deathless heart of Love,<br>
His chant was a hymn of Ignorance and Fate.<br>
He sang the name of Vishnu and the birth<br>
And joy and passion of the mystic world,<br>
And how the stars were made and life began<br>
And the mute regions stirred with the throb of a Soul.<br>
He sang the Inconscient and its secret self,<br>
Its power omnipotent knowing not what it does,<br>
All-shaping without will or thought or sense,<br>
Its blind unerring occult mystery,<br>
And darkness yearning towards the eternal Light,<br>
And Love that broods within the dim abyss<br>
And waits the answer of the human heart,<br>
And death that climbs to immortality.<br>
He sang of the Truth that cries from Night’s blind deeps,<br>
And the Mother-Wisdom hid in Nature’s breast<br>
And the Idea that through her dumbness works<br>
And the miracle of her transforming hands,<br>
Of life that slumbers in the stone and sun<br>
And Mind subliminal in mindless life,<br>
And the Consciousness that wakes in beasts and men.<br>
He sang of the glory and marvel still to be born,<br>
Of Godhead throwing off at last its veil,<br>
Of bodies made divine and life made bliss,<br>
Immortal sweetness clasping immortal might,<br>
Heart sensing heart, thought looking straight at thought,<br>
<br>
416<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
And the delight when every barrier falls,<br>
And the transfiguration and the ecstasy.<br>
And as he sang the demons wept with joy<br>
Foreseeing the end of their long dreadful task<br>
And the defeat for which they hoped in vain,<br>
And glad release from their self-chosen doom<br>
And return into the One from whom they came.<br>
He who has conquered the Immortals’ seats,<br>
Came down to men on earth the Man divine.<br>
As darts a lightning streak, a glory fell<br>
Nearing until the rapt eyes of the sage<br>
Looked out from luminous cloud and, strangely limned,<br>
His face, a beautiful mask of antique joy,<br>
Appearing in light descended where arose<br>
King Aswapati’s palace to the winds<br>
In Madra, flowering up in delicate stone.<br>
There welcomed him the sage and thoughtful king,<br>
At his side a creature beautiful, passionate, wise,<br>
Aspiring like a sacrificial flame<br>
Skyward from its earth-seat through luminous air,<br>
Queen-browed, the human mother of Savitri.<br>
There for an hour untouched by the earth’s siege<br>
They ceased from common life and care and sat<br>
Inclining to the high and rhythmic voice,<br>
While in his measured chant the heavenly seer<br>
Spoke of the toils of men and what the gods<br>
Strive for on earth, and joy that throbs behind<br>
The marvel and the mystery of pain.<br>
He sang to them of the lotus-heart of love<br>
With all its thousand luminous buds of truth,<br>
Which quivering sleeps veiled by apparent things.<br>
It trembles at each touch, it strives to wake<br>
And one day it shall hear a blissful voice<br>
And in the garden of the Spouse shall bloom<br>
When she is seized by her discovered lord.<br>
A mighty shuddering coil of ecstasy<br>
<br>
417<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>

<br>
Crept through the deep heart of the universe.<br>
Out of her Matter’s stupor, her mind’s dreams,<br>
She woke, she looked upon God’s unveiled face.<br>
Even as he sang and rapture stole through earth-time<br>
And caught the heavens, came with a call of hooves,<br>
As of her swift heart hastening, Savitri;<br>
Her radiant tread glimmered across the floor.<br>
A happy wonder in her fathomless gaze,<br>
Changed by the halo of her love she came;<br>
Her eyes rich with a shining mist of joy<br>
As one who comes from a heavenly embassy<br>
Discharging the proud mission of her heart,<br>
One carrying the sanction of the gods<br>
To her love and its luminous eternity,<br>
She stood before her mighty father’s throne<br>
And, eager for beauty on discovered earth<br>
Transformed and new in her heart’s miracle-light,<br>
Saw like a rose of marvel, worshipping,<br>
The fire-tinged sweetness of the son of Heaven.<br>
He flung on her his vast immortal look;<br>
His inner gaze surrounded her with its light<br>
And reining back knowledge from his immortal lips<br>
He cried to her, “Who is this that comes, the bride,<br>
The flame-born, and round her illumined head<br>
Pouring their lights her hymeneal pomps<br>
Move flashing about her? From what green glimmer of glades<br>
Retreating into dewy silences<br>
Or half-seen verge of waters moon-betrayed<br>
Bringst thou this glory of enchanted eyes?<br>
Earth has gold-hued expanses, shadowy hills<br>
That cowl their dreaming phantom heads in night,<br>
And, guarded in a cloistral joy of woods,<br>
Screened banks sink down into felicity<br>
Seized by the curved incessant yearning hands<br>
And ripple-passion of the upgazing stream:<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
Amid cool-lipped murmurs of its pure embrace<br>
They lose their souls on beds of trembling reeds.<br>
And all these are mysterious presences<br>
In which some spirit’s immortal bliss is felt,<br>
And they betray the earth-born heart to joy.<br>
There hast thou paused, and marvelling borne eyes<br>
Unknown, or heard a voice that forced thy life<br>
To strain its rapture through thy listening soul?<br>
Or, if my thought could trust this shimmering gaze,<br>
It would say thou hast not drunk from an earthly cup,<br>
But stepping through azure curtains of the noon<br>
Thou wast surrounded on a magic verge<br>
In brighter countries than man’s eyes can bear.<br>
Assailed by trooping voices of delight<br>
And seized mid a sunlit glamour of the boughs<br>
In faery woods, led down the gleaming slopes<br>
Of Gandhamadan where the Apsaras roam,<br>
Thy limbs have shared the sports which none has seen,<br>
And in god-haunts thy human footsteps strayed,<br>
Thy mortal bosom quivered with god-speech<br>
And thy soul answered to a Word unknown.<br>
What feet of gods, what ravishing flutes of heaven<br>
Have thrilled high melodies round, from near and far<br>
Approaching through the soft and revelling air,<br>
Which still surprised thou hearest? They have fed<br>
Thy silence on some red strange-ecstasied fruit<br>
And thou hast trod the dim moon-peaks of bliss.<br>
Reveal, O winged with light, whence thou hast flown<br>
Hastening bright-hued through the green tangled earth,<br>
Thy body rhythmical with the spring-bird’s call.<br>
The empty roses of thy hands are filled<br>
Only with their own beauty and the thrill<br>
Of a remembered clasp, and in thee glows<br>
A heavenly jar, thy firm deep-honied heart,<br>
New-brimming with a sweet and nectarous wine.<br>
Thou hast not spoken with the kings of pain.<br>
<br>
419<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
Life’s perilous music rings yet to thy ear<br>
Far-melodied, rapid and grand, a Centaur’s song,<br>
Or soft as water plashing mid the hills,<br>
Or mighty as a great chant of many winds.<br>
Moon-bright thou livest in thy inner bliss.<br>
Thou comest like a silver deer through groves<br>
Of coral flowers and buds of glowing dreams,<br>
Or fleest like a wind-goddess through leaves,<br>
Or roamst, O ruby-eyed and snow-winged dove,<br>
Flitting through thickets of thy pure desires<br>
In the unwounded beauty of thy soul.<br>
These things are only images to thy earth,<br>
But truest truth of that which in thee sleeps.<br>
For such is thy spirit, a sister of the gods,<br>
Thy earthly body lovely to the eyes<br>
And thou art kin in joy to heaven’s sons.<br>
O thou who hast come to this great perilous world<br>
Now only seen through the splendour of thy dreams,<br>
Where hardly love and beauty can live safe,<br>
Thyself a being dangerously great,<br>
A soul alone in a golden house of thought<br>
Has lived walled in by the safety of thy dreams.<br>
On heights of happiness leaving doom asleep<br>
Who hunts unseen the unconscious lives of men,<br>
If thy heart could live locked in the ideal’s gold,<br>
As high, as happy might thy waking be!<br>
If for all time doom could be left to sleep!”<br>
He spoke but held his knowledge back from words.<br>
As a cloud plays with lightnings’ vivid laugh,<br>
But still holds back the thunder in its heart,<br>
Only he let bright images escape.<br>
His speech like glimmering music veiled his thoughts;<br>
As a wind flatters the bright summer air,<br>
Pitiful to mortals, only to them it spoke<br>
Of living beauty and of present bliss:<br>
He hid in his all-knowing mind the rest.<br>
<br>
420<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
To those who hearkened to his celestial voice,<br>
The veil heaven’s pity throws on future pain<br>
The Immortals’ sanction seemed of endless joy.<br>
But Aswapati answered to the seer; —<br>
His listening mind had marked the dubious close,<br>
An ominous shadow felt behind the words,<br>
But calm like one who ever sits facing Fate<br>
Here mid the dangerous contours of earth’s life,<br>
He answered covert thought with guarded speech:<br>
“O deathless sage who knowest all things here,<br>
If I could read by the ray of my own wish<br>
Through the carved shield of symbol images<br>
Which thou hast thrown before thy heavenly mind<br>
I might see the steps of a young godlike life<br>
Happily beginning luminous-eyed on earth;<br>
Between the Unknowable and the Unseen<br>
Born on the borders of two wonder-worlds,<br>
It flames out symbols of the infinite<br>
And lives in a great light of inner suns.<br>
For it has read and broken the wizard seals;<br>
It has drunk of the Immortal’s wells of joy,<br>
It has looked across the jewel bars of heaven,<br>
It has entered the aspiring Secrecy,<br>
It sees beyond terrestrial common things<br>
And communes with the Powers that build the worlds,<br>
Till through the shining gates and mystic streets<br>
Of the city of lapis lazuli and pearl<br>
Proud deeds step forth, a rank and march of gods.<br>
Although in pauses of our human lives<br>
Earth keeps for man some short and perfect hours<br>
When the inconstant tread of Time can seem<br>
The eternal moment which the deathless live,<br>
Yet rare that touch upon the mortal’s world:<br>
Hardly a soul and body here are born<br>
In the fierce difficult movement of the stars,<br>
Whose life can keep the paradisal note,<br>
<br>
421<br>

Its rhythm repeat the many-toned melody<br>
Tirelessly throbbing through the rapturous air<br>
Caught in the song that sways the Apsara’s limbs<br>
When she floats gleaming like a cloud of light,<br>
A wave of joy on heaven’s moonstone floor.<br>
Behold this image cast by light and love,<br>
A stanza of the ardour of the gods<br>
Perfectly rhymed, a pillared ripple of gold!<br>
Her body like a brimmed pitcher of delight<br>
Shaped in a splendour of gold-coloured bronze<br>
As if to seize earth’s truth of hidden bliss.<br>
Dream-made illumined mirrors are her eyes<br>
Draped subtly in a slumbrous fringe of jet,<br>
Retaining heaven’s reflections in their depths.<br>
Even as her body, such is she within.<br>
Heaven’s lustrous mornings gloriously recur,<br>
Like drops of fire upon a silver page,<br>
In her young spirit yet untouched with tears.<br>
All beautiful things eternal seem and new<br>
To virgin wonder in her crystal soul.<br>
The unchanging blue reveals its spacious thought;<br>
Marvellous the moon floats on through wondering skies;<br>
Earth’s flowers spring up and laugh at time and death;<br>
The charmed mutations of the enchanter life<br>
Race like bright children past the smiling hours.<br>
If but this joy of life could last, nor pain<br>
Throw its bronze note into her rhythmed days!<br>
Behold her, singer with the prescient gaze,<br>
And let thy blessing chant that this fair child<br>
Shall pour the nectar of a sorrowless life<br>
Around her from her lucid heart of love,<br>
Heal with her bliss the tired breast of earth<br>
And cast like a happy snare felicity.<br>
As grows the great and golden bounteous tree<br>
Flowering by Alacananda’s murmuring waves,<br>
Where with enamoured speed the waters run<br>

<br>
Lisping and babbling to the splendour of morn<br>
And cling with lyric laughter round the knees<br>
Of heaven’s daughters dripping magic rain<br>
Pearl-bright from moon-gold limbs and cloudy hair,<br>
So are her dawns like jewelled leaves of light,<br>
So casts she her felicity on men.<br>
A flame of radiant happiness she was born<br>
And surely will that flame set earth alight:<br>
Doom surely will see her pass and say no word!<br>
But too often here the careless Mother leaves<br>
Her chosen in the envious hands of Fate:<br>
The harp of God falls mute, its call to bliss<br>
Discouraged fails mid earth’s unhappy sounds;<br>
The strings of the siren Ecstasy cry not here<br>
Or soon are silenced in the human heart.<br>
Of sorrow’s songs we have enough: bid once<br>
Her glad and griefless days bring heaven here.<br>
Or must fire always test the great of soul?<br>
Along the dreadful causeway of the Gods,<br>
Armoured with love and faith and sacred joy,<br>
A traveller to the Eternal’s house,<br>
Once let unwounded pass a mortal life.”<br>
But Narad answered not; silent he sat,<br>
Knowing that words are vain and Fate is lord.<br>
He looked into the unseen with seeing eyes,<br>
Then, dallying with the mortal’s ignorance<br>
Like one who knows not, questioning, he cried:<br>
“On what high mission went her hastening wheels?<br>
Whence came she with this glory in her heart<br>
And Paradise made visible in her eyes?<br>
What sudden God has met, what face supreme?”<br>
To whom the king, “The red asoca watched<br>
Her going forth which now sees her return.<br>
Arisen into an air of flaming dawn<br>
Like a bright bird tired of her lonely branch,<br>
To find her own lord, since to her on earth<br>
<br>
423<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
He came not yet, this sweetness wandered forth<br>
Cleaving her way with the beat of her rapid wings.<br>
Led by a distant call her vague swift flight<br>
Threaded the summer morns and sunlit lands.<br>
The happy rest her burdened lashes keep<br>
And these charmed guardian lips hold treasured still.<br>
Virgin who comest perfected by joy,<br>
Reveal the name thy sudden heart-beats learned.<br>
Whom hast thou chosen, kingliest among men?”<br>
And Savitri answered with her still calm voice<br>
As one who speaks beneath the eyes of Fate:<br>
“Father and king, I have carried out thy will.<br>
One whom I sought I found in distant lands;<br>
I have obeyed my heart, I have heard its call.<br>
On the borders of a dreaming wilderness<br>
Mid Shalwa’s giant hills and brooding woods<br>
In his thatched hermitage Dyumatsena dwells,<br>
Blind, exiled, outcast, once a mighty king.<br>
The son of Dyumatsena, Satyavan,<br>
I have met on the wild forest’s lonely verge.<br>
My father, I have chosen. This is done.”<br>
Astonished, all sat silent for a space.<br>
Then Aswapati looked within and saw<br>
A heavy shadow float above the name<br>
Chased by a sudden and stupendous light;<br>
He looked into his daughter’s eyes and spoke:<br>
“Well hast thou done and I approve thy choice.<br>
If this is all, then all is surely well;<br>
If there is more, then all can still be well.<br>
Whether it seem good or evil to men’s eyes,<br>
Only for good the secret Will can work.<br>
Our destiny is written in double terms:<br>
Through Nature’s contraries we draw nearer God;<br>
Out of the darkness we still grow to light.<br>
Death is our road to immortality.<br>
‘Cry woe, cry woe,’ the world’s lost voices wail,<br>
<br>
424<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
Yet conquers the eternal Good at last.”<br>
Then might the sage have spoken, but the king<br>
In haste broke out and stayed the dangerous word:<br>
“O singer of the ultimate ecstasy,<br>
Lend not a dangerous vision to the blind<br>
Because by native right thou hast seen clear.<br>
Impose not on the mortal’s tremulous breast<br>
The dire ordeal that foreknowledge brings;<br>
Demand not now the Godhead in our acts.<br>
Here are not happy peaks the heaven-nymphs roam<br>
Or Coilas or Vaicountha’s starry stair:<br>
Abrupt, jagged hills only the mighty climb<br>
Are here where few dare even think to rise;<br>
Far voices call down from the dizzy rocks,<br>
Chill, slippery, precipitous are the paths.<br>
Too hard the gods are with man’s fragile race;<br>
In their large heavens they dwell exempt from Fate<br>
And they forget the wounded feet of man,<br>
His limbs that faint beneath the whips of grief,<br>
His heart that hears the tread of time and death.<br>
The future’s road is hid from mortal sight:<br>
He moves towards a veiled and secret face.<br>
To light one step in front is all his hope<br>
And only for a little strength he asks<br>
To meet the riddle of his shrouded fate.<br>
Awaited by a vague and half-seen force,<br>
Aware of danger to his uncertain hours<br>
He guards his flickering yearnings from her breath;<br>
He feels not when the dreadful fingers close<br>
Around him with the grasp none can elude.<br>
If thou canst loose her grip, then only speak.<br>
Perhaps from the iron snare there is escape:<br>
Our mind perhaps deceives us with its words<br>
And gives the name of doom to our own choice;<br>
Perhaps the blindness of our will is Fate.”<br>
He said and Narad answered not the king.<br>
<br>
425<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
But now the queen alarmed lifted her voice:<br>
“O seer, thy bright arrival has been timed<br>
To this high moment of a happy life;<br>
Then let the speech benign of griefless spheres<br>
Confirm this blithe conjunction of two stars<br>
And sanction joy with thy celestial voice.<br>
Here drag not in the peril of our thoughts,<br>
Let not our words create the doom they fear.<br>
Here is no cause for dread, no chance for grief<br>
To raise her ominous head and stare at love.<br>
A single spirit in a multitude,<br>
Happy is Satyavan mid earthly men<br>
Whom Savitri has chosen for her mate,<br>
And fortunate the forest hermitage<br>
Where leaving her palace and riches and a throne<br>
My Savitri will dwell and bring in heaven.<br>
Then let thy blessing put the immortals’ seal<br>
On these bright lives’ unstained felicity<br>
Pushing the ominous Shadow from their days.<br>
Too heavy falls a Shadow on man’s heart;<br>
It dares not be too happy upon earth.<br>
It dreads the blow dogging too vivid joys,<br>
A lash unseen in Fate’s extended hand,<br>
The danger lurking in fortune’s proud extremes,<br>
An irony in life’s indulgent smile,<br>
And trembles at the laughter of the gods.<br>
Or if crouches unseen a panther doom,<br>
If wings of Evil brood above that house,<br>
Then also speak, that we may turn aside<br>
And rescue our lives from hazard of wayside doom<br>
And chance entanglement of an alien fate.”<br>
And Narad slowly answered to the queen:<br>
“What help is in prevision to the driven?<br>
Safe doors cry opening near, the doomed pass on.<br>
A future knowledge is an added pain,<br>
A torturing burden and a fruitless light<br>
<br>
426<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
On the enormous scene that Fate has built.<br>
The eternal poet, universal Mind,<br>
Has paged each line of his imperial act;<br>
Invisible the giant actors tread<br>
And man lives like some secret player’s mask.<br>
He knows not even what his lips shall speak.<br>
For a mysterious Power compels his steps<br>
And life is stronger than his trembling soul.<br>
None can refuse what the stark Force demands:<br>
Her eyes are fixed upon her mighty aim;<br>
No cry or prayer can turn her from her path.<br>
She has leaped an arrow from the bow of God.”<br>
His words were theirs who live unforced to grieve<br>
And help by calm the swaying wheels of life<br>
And the long restlessness of transient things<br>
And the trouble and passion of the unquiet world.<br>
As though her own bosom were pierced the mother saw<br>
The ancient human sentence strike her child,<br>
Her sweetness that deserved another fate<br>
Only a larger measure given of tears.<br>
Aspiring to the nature of the gods,<br>
A mind proof-armoured mailed in mighty thoughts,<br>
A will entire couchant behind wisdom’s shield,<br>
Though to still heavens of knowledge she had risen,<br>
Though calm and wise and Aswapati’s queen,<br>
Human was she still and opened her doors to grief;<br>
The stony-eyed injustice she accused<br>
Of the marble godhead of inflexible Law,<br>
Nor sought the strength extreme adversity brings<br>
To lives that stand erect and front the World-Power:<br>
Her heart appealed against the impartial judge,<br>
Taxed with perversity the impersonal One.<br>
Her tranquil spirit she called not to her aid,<br>
But as a common man beneath his load<br>
Grows faint and breathes his pain in ignorant words,<br>
So now she arraigned the world’s impassive will:<br>
<br>
427<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
“What stealthy doom has crept across her path<br>
Emerging from the dark forest’s sullen heart,<br>
What evil thing stood smiling by the way<br>
And wore the beauty of the Shalwa boy?<br>
Perhaps he came an enemy from her past<br>
Armed with a hidden force of ancient wrongs,<br>
Himself unknowing, and seized her unknown.<br>
Here dreadfully entangled love and hate<br>
Meet us blind wanderers mid the perils of Time.<br>
Our days are links of a disastrous chain,<br>
Necessity avenges casual steps;<br>
Old cruelties come back unrecognised,<br>
The gods make use of our forgotten deeds.<br>
Yet all in vain the bitter law was made.<br>
Our own minds are the justicers of doom.<br>
For nothing have we learned, but still repeat<br>
Our stark misuse of self and others’ souls.<br>
There are dire alchemies of the human heart<br>
And fallen from his ethereal element<br>
Love darkens to the spirit of nether gods.<br>
The dreadful angel, angry with his joys<br>
Woundingly sweet he cannot yet forego,<br>
Is pitiless to the soul his gaze disarmed,<br>
He visits with his own pangs his quivering prey<br>
Forcing us to cling enamoured to his grip<br>
As if in love with our own agony.<br>
This is one poignant misery in the world,<br>
And grief has other lassoes for our life.<br>
Our sympathies become our torturers.<br>
Strength have I my own punishment to bear,<br>
Knowing it just, but on this earth perplexed,<br>
Smitten in the sorrow of scourged and helpless things,<br>
Often it faints to meet other suffering eyes.<br>
We are not as the gods who know not grief<br>
And look impassive on a suffering world,<br>
Calm they gaze down on the little human scene<br>
<br>
428<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
And the short-lived passion crossing mortal hearts.<br>
An ancient tale of woe can move us still,<br>
We keep the ache of breasts that breathe no more,<br>
We are shaken by the sight of human pain,<br>
And share the miseries that others feel.<br>
Ours not the passionless lids that cannot age.<br>
Too hard for us is heaven’s indifference:<br>
Our own tragedies are not enough for us,<br>
All pathos and all sufferings we make ours;<br>
We have sorrow for a greatness passed away<br>
And feel the touch of tears in mortal things.<br>
Even a stranger’s anguish rends my heart,<br>
And this, O Narad, is my well-loved child.<br>
Hide not from us our doom, if doom is ours.<br>
This is the worst, an unknown face of Fate,<br>
A terror ominous, mute, felt more than seen<br>
Behind our seat by day, our couch by night,<br>
A Fate lurking in the shadow of our hearts,<br>
The anguish of the unseen that waits to strike.<br>
To know is best, however hard to bear.”<br>
Then cried the sage piercing the mother’s heart,<br>
Forcing to steel the will of Savitri,<br>
His words set free the spring of cosmic Fate.<br>
The great Gods use the pain of human hearts<br>
As a sharp axe to hew their cosmic road:<br>
They squander lavishly men’s blood and tears<br>
For a moment’s purpose in their fateful work.<br>
This cosmic Nature’s balance is not ours<br>
Nor the mystic measure of her need and use.<br>
A single word lets loose vast agencies;<br>
A casual act determines the world’s fate.<br>
So now he set free destiny in that hour.<br>
“The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth.<br>
A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens<br>
Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men,<br>
His figure is the front of Nature’s march,<br>
<br>
429<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
His single being excels the works of Time.<br>
A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven,<br>
Delightful is the soul of Satyavan,<br>
A ray out of the rapturous Infinite,<br>
A silence waking to a hymn of joy.<br>
A divinity and kingliness gird his brow;<br>
His eyes keep a memory from a world of bliss.<br>
As brilliant as a lonely moon in heaven,<br>
Gentle like the sweet bud that spring desires,<br>
Pure like a stream that kisses silent banks,<br>
He takes with bright surprise spirit and sense.<br>
A living knot of golden Paradise,<br>
A blue Immense he leans to the longing world,<br>
Time’s joy borrowed out of eternity,<br>
A star of splendour or a rose of bliss.<br>
In him soul and Nature, equal Presences,<br>
Balance and fuse in a wide harmony.<br>
The Happy in their bright ether have not hearts<br>
More sweet and true than this of mortal make<br>
That takes all joy as the world’s native gift<br>
And to all gives joy as the world’s natural right.<br>
His speech carries a light of inner truth,<br>
And a large-eyed communion with the Power<br>
In common things has made veilless his mind,<br>
A seer in earth-shapes of garbless deity.<br>
A tranquil breadth of sky windless and still<br>
Watching the world like a mind of unplumbed thought,<br>
A silent space musing and luminous<br>
Uncovered by the morning to delight,<br>
A green tangle of trees upon a happy hill<br>
Made into a murmuring nest by southern winds,<br>
These are his images and parallels,<br>
His kin in beauty and in depth his peers.<br>
A will to climb lifts a delight to live,<br>
Heaven’s height companion of earth-beauty’s charm,<br>
An aspiration to the immortals’ air<br>
<br>
430<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
Lain on the lap of mortal ecstasy.<br>
His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts<br>
To live with his own in a glad tenancy,<br>
His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven,<br>
A godhead quarried from the stones of life.<br>
O loss, if death into its elements<br>
Of which his gracious envelope was built,<br>
Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets,<br>
As if earth could not keep too long from heaven<br>
A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods,<br>
A being so rare, of so divine a make!<br>
In one brief year when this bright hour flies back<br>
And perches careless on a branch of Time,<br>
This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth,<br>
This splendour vanishes from the mortal’s sky:<br>
Heaven’s greatness came, but was too great to stay.<br>
Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her;<br>
This day returning Satyavan must die.”<br>
A lightning bright and nude the sentence fell.<br>
But the queen cried: “Vain then can be heaven’s grace!<br>
Heaven mocks us with the brilliance of its gifts,<br>
For Death is a cupbearer of the wine<br>
Of too brief joy held up to mortal lips<br>
For a passionate moment by the careless gods.<br>
But I reject the grace and the mockery.<br>
Mounting thy car go forth, O Savitri,<br>
And travel once more through the peopled lands.<br>
Alas, in the green gladness of the woods<br>
Thy heart has stooped to a misleading call.<br>
Choose once again and leave this fated head,<br>
Death is the gardener of this wonder-tree;<br>
Love’s sweetness sleeps in his pale marble hand.<br>
Advancing in a honeyed line but closed,<br>
A little joy would buy too bitter an end.<br>
Plead not thy choice, for death has made it vain.<br>
Thy youth and radiance were not born to lie<br>
<br>
431<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
A casket void dropped on a careless soil;<br>
A choice less rare may call a happier fate.”<br>
But Savitri answered from her violent heart, —<br>
Her voice was calm, her face was fixed like steel:<br>
“Once my heart chose and chooses not again.<br>
The word I have spoken can never be erased,<br>
It is written in the record book of God.<br>
The truth once uttered, from the earth’s air effaced,<br>
By mind forgotten, sounds immortally<br>
For ever in the memory of Time.<br>
Once the dice fall thrown by the hand of Fate<br>
In an eternal moment of the gods.<br>
My heart has sealed its troth to Satyavan:<br>
Its signature adverse Fate cannot efface,<br>
Its seal not Fate nor Death nor Time dissolve.<br>
Those who shall part who have grown one being within?<br>
Death’s grip can break our bodies, not our souls;<br>
If death take him, I too know how to die.<br>
Let Fate do with me what she will or can;<br>
I am stronger than death and greater than my fate;<br>
My love shall outlast the world, doom falls from me<br>
Helpless against my immortality.<br>
Fate’s law may change, but not my spirit’s will.”<br>
An adamant will, she cast her speech like bronze.<br>
But in the queen’s mind listening her words<br>
Rang like the voice of a self-chosen Doom<br>
Denying every issue of escape.<br>
To her own despair answer the mother made;<br>
As one she cried who in her heavy heart<br>
Labours amid the sobbing of her hopes<br>
To wake a note of help from sadder strings:<br>
“O child, in the magnificence of thy soul<br>
Dwelling on the border of a greater world<br>
And dazzled by thy superhuman thoughts,<br>
Thou lendst eternity to a mortal hope.<br>
Here on this mutable and ignorant earth<br>
<br>
432<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
Who is the lover and who is the friend?<br>
All passes here, nothing remains the same.<br>
None is for any on this transient globe.<br>
He whom thou lovest now, a stranger came<br>
And into a far strangeness shall depart:<br>
His moment’s part once done upon life’s stage<br>
Which for a time was given him from within,<br>
To other scenes he moves and other players<br>
And laughs and weeps mid faces new, unknown.<br>
The body thou hast loved is cast away<br>
Amidst the brute unchanging stuff of worlds<br>
To indifferent mighty Nature and becomes<br>
Crude matter for the joy of others’ lives.<br>
But for our souls, upon the wheel of God<br>
For ever turning, they arrive and go,<br>
Married and sundered in the magic round<br>
Of the great Dancer of the boundless dance.<br>
Our emotions are but high and dying notes<br>
Of his wild music changed compellingly<br>
By the passionate movements of a seeking Heart<br>
In the inconstant links of hour with hour.<br>
To call down heaven’s distant answering song,<br>
To cry to an unseized bliss is all we dare;<br>
Once seized, we lose the heavenly music’s sense;<br>
Too near, the rhythmic cry has fled or failed;<br>
All sweetnesses are baffling symbols here.<br>
Love dies before the lover in our breast:<br>
Our joys are perfumes in a brittle vase.<br>
O then what wreck is this upon Time’s sea<br>
To spread life’s sails to the hurricane desire<br>
And call for pilot the unseeing heart!<br>
O child, wilt thou proclaim, wilt thou then follow<br>
Against the Law that is the eternal will<br>
The autarchy of the rash Titan’s mood<br>
To whom his own fierce will is the one law<br>
In a world where Truth is not, nor Light nor God?<br>
<br>
433<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
Only the gods can speak what now thou speakst.<br>
Thou who art human, think not like a god.<br>
For man, below the god, above the brute,<br>
Is given the calm reason as his guide;<br>
He is not driven by an unthinking will<br>
As are the actions of the bird and beast;<br>
He is not moved by stark Necessity<br>
Like the senseless motion of inconscient things.<br>
The giant’s and the Titan’s furious march<br>
Climbs to usurp the kingdom of the gods<br>
Or skirts the demon magnitudes of Hell;<br>
In the unreflecting passion of their hearts<br>
They dash their lives against the eternal Law<br>
And fall and break by their own violent mass:<br>
The middle path is made for thinking man.<br>
To choose his steps by reason’s vigilant light,<br>
To choose his path among the many paths<br>
Is given him, for each his difficult goal<br>
Hewn out of infinite possibility.<br>
Leave not thy goal to follow a beautiful face.<br>
Only when thou hast climbed above thy mind<br>
And liv’st in the calm vastness of the One<br>
Can love be eternal in the eternal Bliss<br>
And love divine replace the human tie.<br>
There is a shrouded law, an austere force:<br>
It bids thee strengthen thy undying spirit;<br>
It offers its severe benignancies<br>
Of work and thought and measured grave delight<br>
As steps to climb to God’s far secret heights.<br>
Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage,<br>
Each year a mile upon the heavenly Way,<br>
Each dawn opens into a larger Light.<br>
Thy acts are thy helpers, all events are signs,<br>
Waking and sleep are opportunities<br>
Given to thee by an immortal Power.<br>
So canst thou raise thy pure unvanquished spirit,<br>
<br>

<br>
CANTO I: The Word of Fate<br>
<br>
Till spread to heaven in a wide vesper calm,<br>
Indifferent and gentle as the sky,<br>
It greatens slowly into timeless peace.”<br>
But Savitri replied with steadfast eyes:<br>
“My will is part of the eternal Will,<br>
My fate is what my spirit’s strength can make,<br>
My fate is what my spirit’s strength can bear;<br>
My strength is not the Titan’s; it is God’s.<br>
I have discovered my glad reality<br>
Beyond my body in another’s being:<br>
I have found the deep unchanging soul of love.<br>
Then how shall I desire a lonely good,<br>
Or slay, aspiring to white vacant peace,<br>
The endless hope that made my soul spring forth<br>
Out of its infinite solitude and sleep?<br>
My spirit has glimpsed the glory for which it came,<br>
The beating of one vast heart in the flame of things,<br>
My eternity clasped by his eternity<br>
And, tireless of the sweet abysms of Time,<br>
Deep possibility always to love.<br>
This, this is first, last joy and to its throb<br>
The riches of a thousand fortunate years<br>
Are poverty. Nothing to me are death and grief<br>
Or ordinary lives and happy days.<br>
And what to me are common souls of men<br>
Or eyes and lips that are not Satyavan’s?<br>
I have no need to draw back from his arms<br>
And the discovered paradise of his love<br>
And journey into a still infinity.<br>
Only now for my soul in Satyavan<br>
I treasure the rich occasion of my birth:<br>
In sunlight and a dream of emerald ways<br>
I shall walk with him like gods in Paradise.<br>
If for a year, that year is all my life.<br>
And yet I know this is not all my fate<br>
Only to live and love awhile and die.<br>
<br>
435<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
436<br>
<br>
For I know now why my spirit came on earth<br>
And who I am and who he is I love.<br>
I have looked at him from my immortal Self,<br>
I have seen God smile at me in Satyavan;<br>
I have seen the Eternal in a human face.”<br>
Then none could answer to her words. Silent<br>
They sat and looked into the eyes of Fate.<br>
END OF CANTO ONE<br>
<br>
Canto Two<br>
<br>
The Way of Fate and the Problem of Pain<br>
A SILENCE sealed the irrevocable decree,<br>
The word of Fate that fell from heavenly lips<br>
Fixing a doom no power could ever reverse<br>
Unless heaven’s will itself could change its course.<br>
Or so it seemed: yet from the silence rose<br>
One voice that questioned changeless destiny,<br>
A will that strove against the immutable Will.<br>
A mother’s heart had heard the fateful speech<br>
That rang like a sanction to the call of death<br>
And came like a chill close to life and hope.<br>
Yet hope sank down like an extinguished fire.<br>
She felt the leaden inevitable hand<br>
Invade the secrecy of her guarded soul<br>
And smite with sudden pain its still content<br>
And the empire of her hard-won quietude.<br>
Awhile she fell to the level of human mind,<br>
A field of mortal grief and Nature’s law;<br>
She shared, she bore the common lot of men<br>
And felt what common hearts endure in Time.<br>
Voicing earth’s question to the inscrutable power<br>
The queen now turned to the still immobile seer:<br>
Assailed by the discontent in Nature’s depths,<br>
Partner in the agony of dumb driven things<br>
And all the misery, all the ignorant cry,<br>
Passionate like sorrow questioning heaven she spoke.<br>
Lending her speech to the surface soul on earth<br>
She uttered the suffering in the world’s dumb heart<br>
And man’s revolt against his ignorant fate.<br>
“O seer, in the earth’s strange twi-natured life<br>
By what pitiless adverse Necessity<br>
Or what cold freak of a Creator’s will,<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
By what random accident or governed Chance<br>
That shaped a rule out of fortuitous steps,<br>
Made destiny from an hour’s emotion, came<br>
Into the unreadable mystery of Time<br>
The direr mystery of grief and pain?<br>
Is it thy God who made this cruel law?<br>
Or some disastrous Power has marred his work<br>
And he stands helpless to defend or save?<br>
A fatal seed was sown in life’s false start<br>
When evil twinned with good on earthly soil.<br>
Then first appeared the malady of mind,<br>
Its pang of thought, its quest for the aim of life.<br>
It twisted into forms of good and ill<br>
The frank simplicity of the animal’s acts;<br>
It turned the straight path hewn by the body’s gods,<br>
Followed the zigzag of the uncertain course<br>
Of life that wanders seeking for its aim<br>
In the pale starlight falling from thought’s skies,<br>
Its guides the unsure idea, the wavering will.<br>
Lost was the instinct’s safe identity<br>
With the arrow-point of being’s inmost sight,<br>
Marred the sure steps of Nature’s simple walk<br>
And truth and freedom in the growing soul.<br>
Out of some ageless innocence and peace,<br>
Privilege of souls not yet betrayed to birth,<br>
Cast down to suffer on this hard dangerous earth<br>
Our life was born in pain and with a cry.<br>
Although earth-nature welcomes heaven’s breath<br>
Inspiring Matter with the will to live,<br>
A thousand ills assail the mortal’s hours<br>
And wear away the natural joy of life;<br>
Our bodies are an engine cunningly made,<br>
But for all its parts as cunningly are planned,<br>
Contrived ingeniously with demon skill,<br>
Its apt inevitable heritage<br>
Of mortal danger and peculiar pain,<br>

<br>
Its payment of the tax of Time and Fate,<br>
Its way to suffer and its way to die.<br>
This is the ransom of our high estate,<br>
The sign and stamp of our humanity.<br>
A grisly company of maladies<br>
Come, licensed lodgers, into man’s bodily house,<br>
Purveyors of death and torturers of life.<br>
In the malignant hollows of the world,<br>
In its subconscient cavern-passages<br>
Ambushed they lie waiting their hour to leap,<br>
Surrounding with danger the sieged city of life:<br>
Admitted into the citadel of man’s days<br>
They mine his force and maim or suddenly kill.<br>
Ourselves within us lethal forces nurse;<br>
We make of our own enemies our guests:<br>
Out of their holes like beasts they creep and gnaw<br>
The chords of the divine musician’s lyre<br>
Till frayed and thin the music dies away<br>
Or crashing snaps with a last tragic note.<br>
All that we are is like a fort beset:<br>
All that we strive to be alters like a dream<br>
In the grey sleep of Matter’s ignorance.<br>
Mind suffers lamed by the world’s disharmony<br>
And the unloveliness of human things.<br>
A treasure misspent or cheaply, fruitlessly sold<br>
In the bazaar of a blind destiny,<br>
A gift of priceless value from Time’s gods<br>
Lost or mislaid in an uncaring world,<br>
Life is a marvel missed, an art gone wry;<br>
A seeker in a dark and obscure place,<br>
An ill-armed warrior facing dreadful odds,<br>
An imperfect worker given a baffling task,<br>
An ignorant judge of problems Ignorance made,<br>
Its heavenward flights reach closed and keyless gates,<br>
Its glorious outbursts peter out in mire.<br>
On Nature’s gifts to man a curse was laid:<br>

All walks inarmed by its own opposites,<br>
Error is the comrade of our mortal thought<br>
And falsehood lurks in the deep bosom of truth,<br>
Sin poisons with its vivid flowers of joy<br>
Or leaves a red scar burnt across the soul;<br>
Virtue is a grey bondage and a gaol.<br>
At every step is laid for us a snare.<br>
Alien to reason and the spirit’s light,<br>
Our fount of action from a darkness wells;<br>
In ignorance and nescience are our roots.<br>
A growing register of calamities<br>
Is the past’s account, the future’s book of Fate:<br>
The centuries pile man’s follies and man’s crimes<br>
Upon the countless crowd of Nature’s ills;<br>
As if the world’s stone load was not enough,<br>
A crop of miseries obstinately is sown<br>
By his own hand in the furrows of the gods,<br>
The vast increasing tragic harvest reaped<br>
From old misdeeds buried by oblivious Time.<br>
He walks by his own choice into Hell’s trap;<br>
This mortal creature is his own worst foe.<br>
His science is an artificer of doom;<br>
He ransacks earth for means to harm his kind;<br>
He slays his happiness and others’ good.<br>
Nothing has he learned from Time and its history;<br>
Even as of old in the raw youth of Time,<br>
When Earth ignorant ran on the highways of Fate,<br>
Old forms of evil cling to the world’s soul:<br>
War making nought the sweet smiling calm of life,<br>
Battle and rapine, ruin and massacre<br>
Are still the fierce pastimes of man’s warring tribes;<br>
An idiot hour destroys what centuries made,<br>
His wanton rage or frenzied hate lays low<br>
The beauty and greatness by his genius wrought<br>
And the mighty output of a nation’s toil.<br>
All he has achieved he drags to the precipice.<br>

His grandeur he turns to an epic of doom and fall;<br>
His littleness crawls content through squalor and mud,<br>
He calls heaven’s retribution on his head<br>
And wallows in his self-made misery.<br>
A part author of the cosmic tragedy,<br>
His will conspires with death and time and fate.<br>
His brief appearance on the enigmaed earth<br>
Ever recurs but brings no high result<br>
To this wanderer through the aeon-rings of God<br>
That shut his life in their vast longevity.<br>
His soul’s wide search and ever returning hopes<br>
Pursue the useless orbit of their course<br>
In a vain repetition of lost toils<br>
Across a track of soon forgotten lives.<br>
All is an episode in a meaningless tale.<br>
Why is it all and wherefore are we here?<br>
If to some being of eternal bliss<br>
It is our spirit’s destiny to return<br>
Or some still impersonal height of endless calm,<br>
Since That we are and out of That we came,<br>
Whence rose the strange and sterile interlude<br>
Lasting in vain through interminable Time?<br>
Who willed to form or feign a universe<br>
In the cold and endless emptiness of Space?<br>
Or if these beings must be and their brief lives,<br>
What need had the soul of ignorance and tears?<br>
Whence rose the call for sorrow and for pain?<br>
Or all came helplessly without a cause?<br>
What power forced the immortal spirit to birth?<br>
The eternal witness once of eternity,<br>
A deathless sojourner mid transient scenes,<br>
He camps in life’s half-lit obscurity<br>
Amid the debris of his thoughts and dreams.<br>
Or who persuaded it to fall from bliss<br>
And forfeit its immortal privilege?<br>
Who laid on it the ceaseless will to live<br>
<br>

BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
A wanderer in this beautiful, sorrowful world,<br>
And bear its load of joy and grief and love?<br>
Or if no being watches the works of Time,<br>
What hard impersonal Necessity<br>
Compels the vain toil of brief living things?<br>
A great Illusion then has built the stars.<br>
But where then is the soul’s security,<br>
Its poise in this circling of unreal suns?<br>
Or else it is a wanderer from its home<br>
Who strayed into a blind alley of Time and chance<br>
And finds no issue from a meaningless world.<br>
Or where begins and ends Illusion’s reign?<br>
Perhaps the soul we feel is only a dream,<br>
Eternal self a fiction sensed in trance.”<br>
Then after a silence Narad made reply:<br>
Tuning his lips to earthly sound he spoke,<br>
And something now of the deep sense of fate<br>
Weighted the fragile hints of mortal speech.<br>
His forehead shone with vision solemnised,<br>
Turned to a tablet of supernal thoughts<br>
As if characters of an unwritten tongue<br>
Had left in its breadth the inscriptions of the gods.<br>
Bare in that light Time toiled, his unseen works<br>
Detected; the broad-flung far-seeing schemes<br>
Unfinished which his aeoned flight unrolls<br>
Were mapped already in that world-wide look.<br>
“Was then the sun a dream because there is night?<br>
Hidden in the mortal’s heart the Eternal lives:<br>
He lives secret in the chamber of thy soul,<br>
A Light shines there nor pain nor grief can cross.<br>
A darkness stands between thyself and him,<br>
Thou canst not hear or feel the marvellous Guest,<br>
Thou canst not see the beatific sun.<br>
O queen, thy thought is a light of the Ignorance,<br>
Its brilliant curtain hides from thee God’s face.<br>
<br>
442<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Way of Fate and the Problem of Pain<br>
<br>
It illumes a world born from the Inconscience<br>
But hides the Immortal’s meaning in the world.<br>
Thy mind’s light hides from thee the Eternal’s thought,<br>
Thy heart’s hopes hide from thee the Eternal’s will,<br>
Earth’s joys shut from thee the Immortal’s bliss.<br>
Thence rose the need of a dark intruding god,<br>
The world’s dread teacher, the creator, pain.<br>
Where Ignorance is, there suffering too must come;<br>
Thy grief is a cry of darkness to the Light;<br>
Pain was the first-born of the Inconscience<br>
Which was thy body’s dumb original base;<br>
Already slept there pain’s subconscient shape:<br>
A shadow in a shadowy tenebrous womb,<br>
Till life shall move, it waits to wake and be.<br>
In one caul with joy came forth the dreadful Power.<br>
In life’s breast it was born hiding its twin;<br>
But pain came first, then only joy could be.<br>
Pain ploughed the first hard ground of the world-drowse.<br>
By pain a spirit started from the clod,<br>
By pain Life stirred in the subliminal deep.<br>
Interned, submerged, hidden in Matter’s trance<br>
Awoke to itself the dreamer, sleeping Mind;<br>
It made a visible realm out of its dreams,<br>
It drew its shapes from the subconscient depths,<br>
Then turned to look upon the world it had made.<br>
By pain and joy, the bright and tenebrous twins,<br>
The inanimate world perceived its sentient soul,<br>
Else had the Inconscient never suffered change.<br>
Pain is the hammer of the Gods to break<br>
A dead resistance in the mortal’s heart,<br>
His slow inertia as of living stone.<br>
If the heart were not forced to want and weep,<br>
His soul would have lain down content, at ease,<br>
And never thought to exceed the human start<br>
And never learned to climb towards the Sun.<br>
This earth is full of labour, packed with pain;<br>

Throes of an endless birth coerce her still;<br>
The centuries end, the ages vainly pass<br>
And yet the Godhead in her is not born.<br>
The ancient Mother faces all with joy,<br>
Calls for the ardent pang, the grandiose thrill;<br>
For with pain and labour all creation comes.<br>
This earth is full of the anguish of the gods;<br>
Ever they travail driven by Time’s goad,<br>
And strive to work out the eternal Will<br>
And shape the life divine in mortal forms.<br>
His will must be worked out in human breasts<br>
Against the Evil that rises from the gulfs,<br>
Against the world’s Ignorance and its obstinate strength,<br>
Against the stumblings of man’s pervert will,<br>
Against the deep folly of his human mind,<br>
Against the blind reluctance of his heart.<br>
The spirit is doomed to pain till man is free.<br>
There is a clamour of battle, a tramp, a march:<br>
A cry arises like a moaning sea,<br>
A desperate laughter under the blows of death,<br>
A doom of blood and sweat and toil and tears.<br>
Men die that man may live and God be born.<br>
An awful Silence watches tragic Time.<br>
Pain is the hand of Nature sculpturing men<br>
To greatness: an inspired labour chisels<br>
With heavenly cruelty an unwilling mould.<br>
Implacable in the passion of their will,<br>
Lifting the hammers of titanic toil<br>
The demiurges of the universe work;<br>
They shape with giant strokes their own; their sons<br>
Are marked with their enormous stamp of fire.<br>
Although the shaping god’s tremendous touch<br>
Is torture unbearable to mortal nerves,<br>
The fiery spirit grows in strength within<br>
And feels a joy in every titan pang.<br>
He who would save himself lives bare and calm;<br>

He who would save the race must share its pain:<br>
This he shall know who obeys that grandiose urge.<br>
The Great who came to save this suffering world<br>
And rescue out of Time’s shadow and the Law,<br>
Must pass beneath the yoke of grief and pain;<br>
They are caught by the Wheel that they had hoped to break,<br>
On their shoulders they must bear man’s load of fate.<br>
Heaven’s riches they bring, their sufferings count the price<br>
Or they pay the gift of knowledge with their lives.<br>
The Son of God born as the Son of man<br>
Has drunk the bitter cup, owned Godhead’s debt,<br>
The debt the Eternal owes to the fallen kind<br>
His will has bound to death and struggling life<br>
That yearns in vain for rest and endless peace.<br>
Now is the debt paid, wiped off the original score.<br>
The Eternal suffers in a human form,<br>
He has signed salvation’s testament with his blood:<br>
He has opened the doors of his undying peace.<br>
The Deity compensates the creature’s claim,<br>
The Creator bears the law of pain and death;<br>
A retribution smites the incarnate God.<br>
His love has paved the mortal’s road to Heaven:<br>
He has given his life and light to balance here<br>
The dark account of mortal ignorance.<br>
It is finished, the dread mysterious sacrifice,<br>
Offered by God’s martyred body for the world;<br>
Gethsemane and Calvary are his lot,<br>
He carries the cross on which man’s soul is nailed;<br>
His escort is the curses of the crowd;<br>
Insult and jeer are his right’s acknowledgment;<br>
Two thieves slain with him mock his mighty death.<br>
He has trod with bleeding brow the Saviour’s way.<br>
He who has found his identity with God<br>
Pays with the body’s death his soul’s vast light.<br>
His knowledge immortal triumphs by his death.<br>
Hewn, quartered on the scaffold as he falls,<br>
<br>

His crucified voice proclaims, ‘I, I am God;’<br>
‘Yes, all is God,’ peals back Heaven’s deathless call.<br>
The seed of Godhead sleeps in mortal hearts,<br>
The flower of Godhead grows on the world-tree:<br>
All shall discover God in self and things.<br>
But when God’s messenger comes to help the world<br>
And lead the soul of earth to higher things,<br>
He too must carry the yoke he came to unloose;<br>
He too must bear the pang that he would heal:<br>
Exempt and unafflicted by earth’s fate,<br>
How shall he cure the ills he never felt?<br>
He covers the world’s agony with his calm;<br>
But though to the outward eye no sign appears<br>
And peace is given to our torn human hearts,<br>
The struggle is there and paid the unseen price;<br>
The fire, the strife, the wrestle are within.<br>
He carries the suffering world in his own breast;<br>
Its sins weigh on his thoughts, its grief is his:<br>
Earth’s ancient load lies heavy on his soul;<br>
Night and its powers beleaguer his tardy steps,<br>
The Titan adversary’s clutch he bears;<br>
His march is a battle and a pilgrimage.<br>
Life’s evil smites, he is stricken with the world’s pain:<br>
A million wounds gape in his secret heart.<br>
He journeys sleepless through an unending night;<br>
Antagonist forces crowd across his path;<br>
A siege, a combat is his inner life.<br>
Even worse may be the cost, direr the pain:<br>
His large identity and all-harbouring love<br>
Shall bring the cosmic anguish into his depths,<br>
The sorrow of all living things shall come<br>
And knock at his doors and live within his house;<br>
A dreadful cord of sympathy can tie<br>
All suffering into his single grief and make<br>
All agony in all the worlds his own.<br>
He meets an ancient adversary Force,<br>

He is lashed with the whips that tear the world’s worn heart;<br>
The weeping of the centuries visits his eyes:<br>
He wears the blood-glued fiery Centaur shirt,<br>
The poison of the world has stained his throat.<br>
In the market-place of Matter’s capital<br>
Amidst the chafferings of the affair called life<br>
He is tied to the stake of a perennial Fire;<br>
He burns on an unseen original verge<br>
That Matter may be turned to spirit stuff:<br>
He is the victim in his own sacrifice.<br>
The Immortal bound to earth’s mortality<br>
Appearing and perishing on the roads of Time<br>
Creates God’s moment by eternity’s beats.<br>
He dies that the world may be new-born and live.<br>
Even if he escapes the fiercest fires,<br>
Even if the world breaks not in, a drowning sea,<br>
Only by hard sacrifice is high heaven earned:<br>
He must face the fight, the pang who would conquer Hell.<br>
A dark concealed hostility is lodged<br>
In the human depths, in the hidden heart of Time<br>
That claims the right to change and mar God’s work.<br>
A secret enmity ambushes the world’s march;<br>
It leaves a mark on thought and speech and act:<br>
It stamps stain and defect on all things done;<br>
Till it is slain peace is forbidden on earth.<br>
There is no visible foe, but the unseen<br>
Is round us, forces intangible besiege,<br>
Touches from alien realms, thoughts not our own<br>
Overtake us and compel the erring heart;<br>
Our lives are caught in an ambiguous net.<br>
An adversary Force was born of old:<br>
Invader of the life of mortal man,<br>
It hides from him the straight immortal path.<br>
A power came in to veil the eternal Light,<br>
A power opposed to the eternal will<br>
Diverts the messages of the infallible Word,<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
Contorts the contours of the cosmic plan:<br>
A whisper lures to evil the human heart,<br>
It seals up wisdom’s eyes, the soul’s regard,<br>
It is the origin of our suffering here,<br>
It binds earth to calamity and pain.<br>
This all must conquer who would bring down God’s peace.<br>
This hidden foe lodged in the human breast<br>
Man must overcome or miss his higher fate.<br>
This is the inner war without escape.<br>
“Hard is the world-redeemer’s heavy task;<br>
The world itself becomes his adversary,<br>
Those he would save are his antagonists:<br>
This world is in love with its own ignorance,<br>
Its darkness turns away from the saviour light,<br>
It gives the cross in payment for the crown.<br>
His work is a trickle of splendour in a long night;<br>
He sees the long march of Time, the little won;<br>
A few are saved, the rest strive on and fail:<br>
A Sun has passed, on earth Night’s shadow falls.<br>
Yes, there are happy ways near to God’s sun;<br>
But few are they who tread the sunlit path;<br>
Only the pure in soul can walk in light.<br>
An exit is shown, a road of hard escape<br>
From the sorrow and the darkness and the chain;<br>
But how shall a few escaped release the world?<br>
The human mass lingers beneath the yoke.<br>
Escape, however high, redeems not life,<br>
Life that is left behind on a fallen earth.<br>
Escape cannot uplift the abandoned race<br>
Or bring to it victory and the reign of God.<br>
A greater power must come, a larger light.<br>
Although Light grows on earth and Night recedes,<br>

He still must labour on, his work half done.<br>
One yet may come armoured, invincible;<br>
His will immobile meets the mobile hour;<br>
The world’s blows cannot bend that victor head;<br>
Calm and sure are his steps in the growing Night;<br>
The goal recedes, he hurries not his pace,<br>
He turns not to high voices in the night;<br>
He asks no aid from the inferior gods;<br>
His eyes are fixed on his immutable aim.<br>
Man turns aside or chooses easier paths;<br>
He keeps to the one high and difficult road<br>
That sole can climb to the Eternal’s peaks;<br>
The ineffable planes already have felt his tread;<br>
He has made heaven and earth his instruments,<br>
But the limits fall from him of earth and heaven;<br>
Their law he transcends but uses as his means.<br>
He has seized life’s hands, he has mastered his own heart.<br>
The feints of Nature mislead not his sight,<br>
Inflexible his look towards Truth’s far end;<br>
Fate’s deaf resistance cannot break his will.<br>
In the dreadful passages, the fatal paths,<br>
Invulnerable his soul, his heart unslain,<br>
He lives through the opposition of earth’s Powers<br>
And Nature’s ambushes and the world’s attacks.<br>
His spirit’s stature transcending pain and bliss,<br>
He fronts evil and good with calm and equal eyes.<br>
He too must grapple with the riddling Sphinx<br>
And plunge into her long obscurity.<br>
He has broken into the Inconscient’s depths<br>
That veil themselves even from their own regard:<br>
He has seen God’s slumber shape these magic worlds.<br>
He has watched the dumb God fashioning Matter’s frame,<br>
Dreaming the dreams of its unknowing sleep,<br>
And watched the unconscious Force that built the stars.<br>
He has learned the Inconscient’s workings and its law,<br>
Its incoherent thoughts and rigid acts,<br>

Its random calls, its whispers falsely true,<br>
Misleaders of the hooded listening soul.<br>
All things come to its ear but nothing abides;<br>
All rose from the silence, all goes back to its hush.<br>
Its somnolence founded the universe,<br>
Its obscure waking makes the world seem vain.<br>
Arisen from Nothingness and towards Nothingness turned,<br>

All things perverse his power must unknot:<br>

He must learn its cosmic dark necessity,<br>
Its right and its dire roots in Nature’s soil.<br>

And justifies the Titan’s erring pride<br>
And the falsehood lurking in earth’s crooked dreams:<br>
He must enter the eternity of Night<br>
And know God’s darkness as he knows his Sun.<br>
For this he must go down into the pit,<br>
For this he must invade the dolorous Vasts.<br>
Imperishable and wise and infinite,<br>

By the quaking of the world beneath his tread<br>

Can find no more the light of eternity;<br>

Even pain and grief are garbs of world-delight,<br>

The soul looked out from its felicity.<br>
It felt the Spirit’s interminable bliss,<br>
It knew itself deathless, timeless, spaceless, one,<br>
It saw the Eternal, lived in the Infinite.<br>
Then, curious of a shadow thrown by Truth,<br>
It strained towards some otherness of self,<br>
It was drawn to an unknown Face peering through night.<br>
It sensed a negative infinity,<br>
A void supernal whose immense excess<br>
Imitating God and everlasting Time<br>
Offered a ground for Nature’s adverse birth<br>
And Matter’s rigid hard unconsciousness<br>
Harbouring the brilliance of a transient soul<br>
That lights up birth and death and ignorant life.<br>

A Mind arose that stared at Nothingness<br>
Till figures formed of what could never be;<br>
It housed the contrary of all that is.<br>
A Nought appeared as Being’s huge sealed cause,<br>
Its dumb support in a blank infinite,<br>
In whose abysm spirit must disappear:<br>
A darkened Nature lived and held the seed<br>
Of Spirit hidden and feigning not to be.<br>
Eternal Consciousness became a freak<br>
Of an unsouled almighty Inconscient<br>
And, breathed no more as spirit’s native air,<br>
Bliss was an incident of a mortal hour,<br>
A stranger in the insentient universe.<br>
As one drawn by the grandeur of the Void<br>
The soul attracted leaned to the Abyss:<br>
It longed for the adventure of Ignorance<br>
And the marvel and surprise of the Unknown<br>
And the endless possibility that lurked<br>
In the womb of Chaos and in Nothing’s gulf<br>
Or looked from the unfathomed eyes of Chance.<br>
It tired of its unchanging happiness,<br>
It turned away from immortality:<br>
It was drawn to hazard’s call and danger’s charm,<br>
It yearned to the pathos of grief, the drama of pain,<br>
Perdition’s peril, the wounded bare escape,<br>
The music of ruin and its glamour and crash,<br>
The savour of pity and the gamble of love<br>
And passion and the ambiguous face of Fate.<br>
A world of hard endeavour and difficult toil,<br>
And battle on extinction’s perilous verge,<br>
A clash of forces, a vast incertitude,<br>
The joy of creation out of Nothingness,<br>
Strange meetings on the roads of Ignorance<br>
And the companionship of half-known souls<br>
Or the solitary greatness and lonely force<br>
Of a separate being conquering its world,<br>

BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>

Called it from its too safe eternity.<br>
A huge descent began, a giant fall:<br>
For what the spirit sees, creates a truth<br>
And what the soul imagines is made a world.<br>
A Thought that leaped from the Timeless can become,<br>
Indicator of cosmic consequence<br>
And the itinerary of the gods,<br>
A cyclic movement in eternal Time.<br>
Thus came, born from a blind tremendous choice,<br>
This great perplexed and discontented world,<br>
This haunt of Ignorance, this home of Pain:<br>
There are pitched desire’s tents, grief’s headquarters.<br>
A vast disguise conceals the Eternal’s bliss.”<br>
Then Aswapati answered to the seer:<br>
“Is then the spirit ruled by an outward world?<br>
O seer, is there no remedy within?<br>
But what is Fate if not the spirit’s will<br>
After long time fulfilled by cosmic Force?<br>
I deemed a mighty Power had come with her;<br>
Is not that Power the high compeer of Fate?”<br>
But Narad answered covering truth with truth:<br>
“O Aswapati, random seem the ways<br>
Along whose banks your footsteps stray or run<br>
In casual hours or moments of the gods,<br>
Yet your least stumblings are foreseen above.<br>
Infallibly the curves of life are drawn<br>
Following the stream of Time through the unknown;<br>
They are led by a clue the calm immortals keep.<br>
This blazoned hieroglyph of prophet morns<br>
A meaning more sublime in symbols writes<br>
Than sealed Thought wakes to, but of this high script<br>
How shall my voice convince the mind of earth?<br>
Heaven’s wiser love rejects the mortal’s prayer;<br>
Unblinded by the breath of his desire,<br>
Unclouded by the mists of fear and hope,<br>

<br>
It bends above the strife of love with death;<br>
It keeps for her her privilege of pain.<br>
A greatness in thy daughter’s soul resides<br>
That can transform herself and all around<br>
But must cross on stones of suffering to its goal.<br>
Although designed like a nectar cup of heaven,<br>
Of heavenly ether made she sought this air,<br>
She too must share the human need of grief<br>
And all her cause of joy transmute to pain.<br>
The mind of mortal man is led by words,<br>
His sight retires behind the walls of Thought<br>
And looks out only through half-opened doors.<br>
He cuts the boundless Truth into sky-strips<br>
And every strip he takes for all the heavens.<br>
He stares at infinite possibility<br>
And gives to the plastic Vast the name of Chance;<br>
He sees the long results of an all-wise Force<br>
Planning a sequence of steps in endless Time<br>
But in its links imagines a senseless chain<br>
Or the dead hand of cold Necessity;<br>
He answers not to the mystic Mother’s heart,<br>
Misses the ardent heavings of her breast<br>
And feels cold rigid limbs of lifeless Law.<br>
The will of the Timeless working out in Time<br>
In the free absolute steps of cosmic Truth<br>
He thinks a dead machine or unconscious Fate.<br>
A Magician’s formulas have made Matter’s laws<br>
And while they last, all things by them are bound;<br>
But the spirit’s consent is needed for each act<br>
And Freedom walks in the same pace with Law.<br>
All here can change if the Magician choose.<br>
If human will could be made one with God’s,<br>
If human thought could echo the thoughts of God,<br>
Man might be all-knowing and omnipotent;<br>
But now he walks in Nature’s doubtful ray.<br>
Yet can the mind of man receive God’s light,<br>
<br>

BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
The force of man can be driven by God’s force,<br>
Then is he a miracle doing miracles.<br>
For only so can he be Nature’s king.<br>
It is decreed and Satyavan must die;<br>
The hour is fixed, chosen the fatal stroke.<br>
What else shall be is written in her soul<br>
But till the hour reveals the fateful script,<br>
The writing waits illegible and mute.<br>
Fate is Truth working out in Ignorance.<br>
O King, thy fate is a transaction done<br>
At every hour between Nature and thy soul<br>
With God for its foreseeing arbiter.<br>
Fate is a balance drawn in Destiny’s book.<br>
Man can accept his fate, he can refuse.<br>
Even if the One maintains the unseen decree<br>
He writes thy refusal in thy credit page:<br>
For doom is not a close, a mystic seal.<br>
Arisen from the tragic crash of life,<br>
Arisen from the body’s torture and death,<br>
The spirit rises mightier by defeat;<br>
Its godlike wings grow wider with each fall.<br>
Its splendid failures sum to victory.<br>
O man, the events that meet thee on thy road,<br>
Though they smite thy body and soul with joy and grief,<br>
Are not thy fate, — they touch thee awhile and pass;<br>
Even death can cut not short thy spirit’s walk:<br>
Thy goal, the road thou choosest are thy fate.<br>
On the altar throwing thy thoughts, thy heart, thy works,<br>
Thy fate is a long sacrifice to the gods<br>
Till they have opened to thee thy secret self<br>
And made thee one with the indwelling God.<br>
O soul, intruder in Nature’s ignorance,<br>
Armed traveller to the unseen supernal heights,<br>
Thy spirit’s fate is a battle and ceaseless march<br>
Against invisible opponent Powers,<br>
A passage from Matter into timeless self.<br>

<br>
Adventurer through blind unforeseeing Time,<br>
A forced advance through a long line of lives,<br>
It pushes its spearhead through the centuries.<br>
Across the dust and mire of the earthly plain,<br>
On many guarded lines and dangerous fronts,<br>
In dire assaults, in wounded slow retreats,<br>
Holding the ideal’s ringed and battered fort<br>
Or fighting against odds in lonely posts,<br>
Or camped in night around the bivouac’s fires<br>
Awaiting the tardy trumpets of the dawn,<br>
In hunger and in plenty and in pain,<br>
Through peril and through triumph and through fall,<br>
Through life’s green lanes and over her desert sands,<br>
Up the bald moor, along the sunlit ridge,<br>
In serried columns with a straggling rear<br>
Led by its nomad vanguard’s signal fires,<br>
Marches the army of the waylost god.<br>
Then late the joy ineffable is felt,<br>
Then he remembers his forgotten self;<br>
He has refound the skies from which he fell.<br>
At length his front’s indomitable line<br>
Forces the last passes of the Ignorance:<br>
Advancing beyond Nature’s last known bounds,<br>
Reconnoitring the formidable unknown,<br>
Beyond the landmarks of things visible,<br>
It mounts through a miraculous upper air<br>
Till climbing the mute summit of the world<br>
He stands upon the splendour-peaks of God.<br>
In vain thou mournst that Satyavan must die;<br>
His death is a beginning of greater life,<br>
Death is the spirit’s opportunity.<br>
A vast intention has brought two souls close<br>
And love and death conspire towards one great end.<br>
For out of danger and pain heaven-bliss shall come,<br>
Time’s unforeseen event, God’s secret plan.<br>
This world was not built with random bricks of Chance,<br>

BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>
<br>
A blind god is not destiny’s architect;<br>
A conscious power has drawn the plan of life,<br>
There is a meaning in each curve and line.<br>
It is an architecture high and grand<br>
By many named and nameless masons built<br>
In which unseeing hands obey the Unseen,<br>
And of its master-builders she is one.<br>
“Queen, strive no more to change the secret will;<br>
Time’s accidents are steps in its vast scheme.<br>
Bring not thy brief and helpless human tears<br>
Across the fathomless moments of a heart<br>
That knows its single will and God’s as one:<br>
It can embrace its hostile destiny;<br>
It sits apart with grief and facing death,<br>
Affronting adverse fate armed and alone.<br>
In this enormous world standing apart<br>
In the mightiness of her silent spirit’s will,<br>
In the passion of her soul of sacrifice<br>
Her lonely strength facing the universe,<br>
Affronting fate, asks not man’s help nor god’s:<br>
Sometimes one life is charged with earth’s destiny,<br>
It cries not for succour from the time-bound powers.<br>
Alone she is equal to her mighty task.<br>
Intervene not in a strife too great for thee,<br>
A struggle too deep for mortal thought to sound,<br>
Its question to this Nature’s rigid bounds<br>
When the soul fronts nude of garbs the infinite,<br>
Its too vast theme of a lonely mortal will<br>
Pacing the silence of eternity.<br>
As a star, uncompanioned, moves in heaven<br>
Unastonished by the immensities of Space,<br>
Travelling infinity by its own light,<br>
The great are strongest when they stand alone.<br>
A God-given might of being is their force,<br>
A ray from self’s solitude of light the guide;<br>
The soul that can live alone with itself meets God;<br>

<br>
Its lonely universe is their rendezvous.<br>
A day may come when she must stand unhelped<br>
On a dangerous brink of the world’s doom and hers,<br>
Carrying the world’s future on her lonely breast,<br>
Carrying the human hope in a heart left sole<br>
To conquer or fail on a last desperate verge,<br>
Alone with death and close to extinction’s edge.<br>
Her single greatness in that last dire scene<br>
Must cross alone a perilous bridge in Time<br>
And reach an apex of world-destiny<br>
Where all is won or all is lost for man.<br>
In that tremendous silence lone and lost<br>
Of a deciding hour in the world’s fate,<br>
In her soul’s climbing beyond mortal time<br>
When she stands sole with Death or sole with God<br>
Apart upon a silent desperate brink,<br>
Alone with her self and death and destiny<br>
As on some verge between Time and Timelessness<br>
When being must end or life rebuild its base,<br>
Alone she must conquer or alone must fall.<br>
No human aid can reach her in that hour,<br>
No armoured god stand shining at her side.<br>
Cry not to heaven, for she alone can save.<br>
For this the silent Force came missioned down;<br>
In her the conscious Will took human shape:<br>
She only can save herself and save the world.<br>
O queen, stand back from that stupendous scene,<br>
Come not between her and her hour of Fate.<br>
Her hour must come and none can intervene:<br>
Think not to turn her from her heaven-sent task,<br>
Strive not to save her from her own high will.<br>
Thou hast no place in that tremendous strife;<br>
Thy love and longing are not arbiters there;<br>
Leave the world’s fate and her to God’s sole guard.<br>
Even if he seems to leave her to her lone strength,<br>
Even though all falters and falls and sees an end<br>
<br>
461<br>
<br>
BOOK VI: The Book of Fate<br>

<br>
And the heart fails and only are death and night,<br>
God-given her strength can battle against doom<br>
Even on a brink where Death alone seems close<br>
And no human strength can hinder or can help.<br>
Think not to intercede with the hidden Will,<br>
Intrude not twixt her spirit and its force<br>
But leave her to her mighty self and Fate.”<br>
He spoke and ceased and left the earthly scene.<br>
Away from the strife and suffering on our globe,<br>
He turned towards his far-off blissful home.<br>
A brilliant arrow pointing straight to heaven,<br>
The luminous body of the ethereal seer<br>
Assailed the purple glory of the noon<br>
And disappeared like a receding star<br>
Vanishing into the light of the Unseen.<br>
But still a cry was heard in the infinite,<br>
And still to the listening soul on mortal earth<br>
A high and far imperishable voice<br>
Chanted the anthem of eternal love.<br>

The Joy of Union; the Ordeal of the Foreknowledge<br>
of Death and the Heart’s Grief and Pain<br>
FATE followed her foreseen immutable road.<br>
Man’s hopes and longings build the journeying wheels<br>
That bear the body of his destiny<br>
And lead his blind will towards an unknown goal.<br>
His fate within him shapes his acts and rules;<br>
Its face and form already are born in him,<br>
Its parentage is in his secret soul:<br>
Here Matter seems to mould the body’s life<br>
And the soul follows where its nature drives.<br>
Nature and Fate compel his free-will’s choice.<br>
But greater spirits this balance can reverse<br>
And make the soul the artist of its fate.<br>
This is the mystic truth our ignorance hides:<br>
Doom is a passage for our inborn force,<br>
Our ordeal is the hidden spirit’s choice,<br>
Ananke is our being’s own decree.<br>
All was fulfilled the heart of Savitri<br>
Flower-sweet and adamant, passionate and calm,<br>
Had chosen and on her strength’s unbending road<br>
Forced to its issue the long cosmic curve.<br>
Once more she sat behind loud hastening hooves;<br>
A speed of armoured squadrons and a voice<br>
Far-heard of chariots bore her from her home.<br>
A couchant earth wakened in its dumb muse<br>
Looked up at her from a vast indolence:<br>
Hills wallowing in a bright haze, large lands<br>
That lolled at ease beneath the summer heavens,<br>
Region on region spacious in the sun,<br>
Cities like chrysolites in the wide blaze<br>
And yellow rivers pacing lion-maned<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Led to the Shalwa marches’ emerald line,<br>
A happy front to iron vastnesses<br>
And austere peaks and titan solitudes.<br>
Once more was near the fair and fated place,<br>
The borders gleaming with the groves’ delight<br>
Where first she met the face of Satyavan<br>
And he saw like one waking into a dream<br>
Some timeless beauty and reality,<br>
The moon-gold sweetness of heaven’s earth-born child.<br>
The past receded and the future neared:<br>
Far now behind lay Madra’s spacious halls,<br>
The white carved pillars, the cool dim alcoves,<br>
The tinged mosaic of the crystal floors,<br>
The towered pavilions, the wind-rippled pools<br>
And gardens humming with the murmur of bees,<br>
Forgotten soon or a pale memory<br>
The fountain’s plash in the white stone-bound pool,<br>
The thoughtful noontide’s brooding solemn trance,<br>
The colonnade’s dream grey in the quiet eve,<br>
The slow moonrise gliding in front of Night.<br>
Left far behind were now the faces known,<br>
The happy silken babble on laughter’s lips<br>
And the close-clinging clasp of intimate hands<br>
And adoration’s light in cherished eyes<br>
Offered to the one sovereign of their life.<br>
Nature’s primaeval loneliness was here:<br>
Here only was the voice of bird and beast, —<br>
The ascetic’s exile in the dim-souled huge<br>
Inhuman forest far from cheerful sound<br>
Of man’s blithe converse and his crowded days.<br>
In a broad eve with one red eye of cloud,<br>
Through a narrow opening, a green flowered cleft,<br>
Out of the stare of sky and soil they came<br>
Into a mighty home of emerald dusk.<br>
There onward led by a faint brooding path<br>
Which toiled through the shadow of enormous trunks<br>
<br>
466<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Joy of Union; the Ordeal of Foreknowledge<br>
<br>
And under arches misers of sunshine,<br>
They saw low thatched roofs of a hermitage<br>
Huddled beneath a patch of azure hue<br>
In a sunlit clearing that seemed the outbreak<br>
Of a glad smile in the forest’s monstrous heart,<br>
A rude refuge of the thought and will of man<br>
Watched by the crowding giants of the wood.<br>
Arrived in that rough-hewn homestead they gave,<br>
Questioning no more the strangeness of her fate,<br>
Their pride and loved one to the great blind king,<br>
A regal pillar of fallen mightiness<br>
And the stately care-worn woman once a queen<br>
Who now hoped nothing for herself from life,<br>
But all things only hoped for her one child,<br>
Calling on that single head from partial Fate<br>
All joy of earth, all heaven’s beatitude.<br>
Adoring wisdom and beauty like a young god’s,<br>
She saw him loved by heaven as by herself,<br>
She rejoiced in his brightness and believed in his fate<br>
And knew not of the evil drawing near.<br>
Lingering some days upon the forest verge<br>
Like men who lengthen out departure’s pain,<br>
Unwilling to separate sorrowful clinging hands,<br>
Unwilling to see for the last time a face,<br>
Heavy with the sorrow of a coming day<br>
And wondering at the carelessness of Fate<br>
Who breaks with idle hands her supreme works,<br>
They parted from her with pain-fraught burdened hearts<br>
As forced by inescapable fate we part<br>
From one whom we shall never see again;<br>
Driven by the singularity of her fate,<br>
Helpless against the choice of Savitri’s heart<br>
They left her to her rapture and her doom<br>
In the tremendous forest’s savage charge.<br>
All put behind her that was once her life,<br>
All welcomed that henceforth was his and hers,<br>
<br>

BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
She abode with Satyavan in the wild woods:<br>
Priceless she deemed her joy so close to death;<br>
Apart with love she lived for love alone.<br>
As if self-poised above the march of days,<br>
Her immobile spirit watched the haste of Time,<br>
A statue of passion and invincible force,<br>
An absolutism of sweet imperious will,<br>
A tranquillity and a violence of the gods<br>
Indomitable and immutable.<br>
At first to her beneath the sapphire heavens<br>
The sylvan solitude was a gorgeous dream,<br>
An altar of the summer’s splendour and fire,<br>
A sky-topped flower-hung palace of the gods<br>
And all its scenes a smile on rapture’s lips<br>
And all its voices bards of happiness.<br>
There was a chanting in the casual wind,<br>
There was a glory in the least sunbeam;<br>
Night was a chrysoprase on velvet cloth,<br>
A nestling darkness or a moonlit deep;<br>
Day was a purple pageant and a hymn,<br>
A wave of the laughter of light from morn to eve.<br>
His absence was a dream of memory,<br>
His presence was the empire of a god.<br>
A fusing of the joys of earth and heaven,<br>
A tremulous blaze of nuptial rapture passed,<br>
A rushing of two spirits to be one,<br>
A burning of two bodies in one flame.<br>
Opened were gates of unforgettable bliss:<br>
Two lives were locked within an earthly heaven<br>
And fate and grief fled from that fiery hour.<br>
But soon now failed the summer’s ardent breath<br>
And throngs of blue-black clouds crept through the sky<br>
And rain fled sobbing over the dripping leaves<br>
And storm became the forest’s titan voice.<br>
Then listening to the thunder’s fatal crash<br>

<br>
And the fugitive pattering footsteps of the showers<br>
And the long unsatisfied panting of the wind<br>
And sorrow muttering in the sound-vexed night,<br>
The grief of all the world came near to her.<br>
Night’s darkness seemed her future’s ominous face.<br>
The shadow of her lover’s doom arose<br>
And fear laid hands upon her mortal heart.<br>
The moments swift and ruthless raced; alarmed<br>
Her thoughts, her mind remembered Narad’s date.<br>
A trembling moved accountant of her riches,<br>
She reckoned the insufficient days between:<br>
A dire expectancy knocked at her breast;<br>
Dreadful to her were the footsteps of the hours:<br>
Grief came, a passionate stranger to her gate:<br>
Banished when in his arms, out of her sleep<br>
It rose at morn to look into her face.<br>
Vainly she fled into abysms of bliss<br>
From her pursuing foresight of the end.<br>
The more she plunged into love that anguish grew;<br>
Her deepest grief from sweetest gulfs arose.<br>
Remembrance was a poignant pang, she felt<br>
Each day a golden leaf torn cruelly out<br>
From her too slender book of love and joy.<br>
Thus swaying in strong gusts of happiness<br>
And swimming in foreboding’s sombre waves<br>
And feeding sorrow and terror with her heart, —<br>
For now they sat among her bosom’s guests<br>
Or in her inner chamber paced apart, —<br>
Her eyes stared blind into the future’s night.<br>
Out of her separate self she looked and saw,<br>
Moving amid the unconscious faces loved,<br>
In mind a stranger though in heart so near,<br>
The ignorant smiling world go happily by<br>
Upon its way towards an unknown doom<br>
And wondered at the careless lives of men.<br>
As if in different worlds they walked, though close,<br>

<br>
They confident of the returning sun,<br>
They wrapped in little hourly hopes and tasks, —<br>
She in her dreadful knowledge was alone.<br>
The rich and happy secrecy that once<br>
Enshrined her as if in a silver bower<br>
Apart in a bright nest of thoughts and dreams<br>
Made room for tragic hours of solitude<br>
And lonely grief that none could share or know,<br>
A body seeing the end too soon of joy<br>
And the fragile happiness of its mortal love.<br>
Her quiet visage still and sweet and calm,<br>
Her graceful daily acts were now a mask;<br>
In vain she looked upon her depths to find<br>
A ground of stillness and the spirit’s peace.<br>
Still veiled from her was the silent Being within<br>
Who sees life’s drama pass with unmoved eyes,<br>
Supports the sorrow of the mind and heart<br>
And bears in human breasts the world and fate.<br>
A glimpse or flashes came, the Presence was hid.<br>
Only her violent heart and passionate will<br>
Were pushed in front to meet the immutable doom;<br>
Defenceless, nude, bound to her human lot<br>
They had no means to act, no way to save.<br>
These she controlled, nothing was shown outside:<br>
She was still to them the child they knew and loved;<br>
The sorrowing woman they saw not within.<br>
No change was in her beautiful motions seen:<br>
A worshipped empress all once vied to serve,<br>
She made herself the diligent serf of all,<br>
Nor spared the labour of broom and jar and well,<br>
Or close gentle tending or to heap the fire<br>
Of altar and kitchen, no slight task allowed<br>
To others that her woman’s strength might do.<br>
In all her acts a strange divinity shone:<br>
Into a simplest movement she could bring<br>
A oneness with earth’s glowing robe of light,<br>
A lifting up of common acts by love.<br>

<br>
All-love was hers and its one heavenly cord<br>
Bound all to all with her as golden tie.<br>
But when her grief to the surface pressed too close,<br>
These things, once gracious adjuncts of her joy,<br>
Seemed meaningless to her, a gleaming shell,<br>
Or were a round mechanical and void,<br>
Her body’s actions shared not by her will.<br>
Always behind this strange divided life<br>
Her spirit like a sea of living fire<br>
Possessed her lover and to his body clung,<br>
One locked embrace to guard its threatened mate.<br>
At night she woke through the slow silent hours<br>
Brooding on the treasure of his bosom and face,<br>
Hung o’er the sleep-bound beauty of his brow<br>
Or laid her burning cheek upon his feet.<br>
Waking at morn her lips endlessly clung to his,<br>
Unwilling ever to separate again<br>
Or lose that honeyed drain of lingering joy,<br>
Unwilling to loose his body from her breast,<br>
The warm inadequate signs that love must use.<br>
Intolerant of the poverty of Time<br>
Her passion catching at the fugitive hours<br>
Willed the expense of centuries in one day<br>
Of prodigal love and the surf of ecstasy;<br>
Or else she strove even in mortal time<br>
To build a little room for timelessness<br>
By the deep union of two human lives,<br>
Her soul secluded shut into his soul.<br>
After all was given she demanded still;<br>
Even by his strong embrace unsatisfied,<br>
She longed to cry, “O tender Satyavan,<br>
O lover of my soul, give more, give more<br>
Of love while yet thou canst, to her thou lov’st.<br>
Imprint thyself for every nerve to keep<br>
That thrills to thee the message of my heart.<br>
For soon we part and who shall know how long<br>
Before the great wheel in its monstrous round<br>

<br>
Restore us to each other and our love?”<br>
Too well she loved to speak a fateful word<br>
And lay her burden on his happy head;<br>
She pressed the outsurging grief back into her breast<br>
To dwell within silent, unhelped, alone.<br>
But Satyavan sometimes half understood,<br>
Or felt at least with the uncertain answer<br>
Of our thought-blinded hearts the unuttered need,<br>
The unplumbed abyss of her deep passionate want.<br>
All of his speeding days that he could spare<br>
From labour in the forest hewing wood<br>
And hunting food in the wild sylvan glades<br>
And service to his father’s sightless life<br>
He gave to her and helped to increase the hours<br>
By the nearness of his presence and his clasp,<br>
And lavish softness of heart-seeking words<br>
And the close beating felt of heart on heart.<br>
All was too little for her bottomless need.<br>
If in his presence she forgot awhile,<br>
Grief filled his absence with its aching touch;<br>
She saw the desert of her coming days<br>
Imaged in every solitary hour.<br>
Although with a vain imaginary bliss<br>
Of fiery union through death’s door of escape<br>
She dreamed of her body robed in funeral flame,<br>
She knew she must not clutch that happiness<br>
To die with him and follow, seizing his robe<br>
Across our other countries, travellers glad<br>
Into the sweet or terrible Beyond.<br>
For those sad parents still would need her here<br>
To help the empty remnant of their day.<br>
Often it seemed to her the ages’ pain<br>
Had pressed their quintessence into her single woe,<br>
Concentrating in her a tortured world.<br>
Thus in the silent chamber of her soul<br>
Cloistering her love to live with secret grief<br>
She dwelt like a dumb priest with hidden gods<br>

<br>
Unappeased by the wordless offering of her days,<br>
Lifting to them her sorrow like frankincense,<br>
Her life the altar, herself the sacrifice.<br>
Yet ever they grew into each other more<br>
Until it seemed no power could rend apart,<br>
Since even the body’s walls could not divide.<br>
For when he wandered in the forest, oft<br>
Her conscious spirit walked with him and knew<br>
His actions as if in herself he moved;<br>
He, less aware, thrilled with her from afar.<br>
Always the stature of her passion grew;<br>
Grief, fear became the food of mighty love.<br>
Increased by its torment it filled the whole world;<br>
It was all her life, became her whole earth and heaven.<br>
Although life-born, an infant of the hours,<br>
Immortal it walked unslayable as the gods:<br>
Her spirit stretched measureless in strength divine,<br>
An anvil for the blows of Fate and Time:<br>
Or tired of sorrow’s passionate luxury,<br>
Grief’s self became calm, dull-eyed, resolute,<br>
Awaiting some issue of its fiery struggle,<br>
Some deed in which it might for ever cease,<br>
Victorious over itself and death and tears.<br>
The year now paused upon the brink of change.<br>
No more the storms sailed with stupendous wings<br>
And thunder strode in wrath across the world,<br>
But still was heard a muttering in the sky<br>
And rain dripped wearily through the mournful air<br>
And grey slow-drifting clouds shut in the earth.<br>
So her grief’s heavy sky shut in her heart.<br>
A still self hid behind but gave no light:<br>
No voice came down from the forgotten heights;<br>
Only in the privacy of its brooding pain<br>
Her human heart spoke to the body’s fate.<br>

Repressing in her bosom its load of grief,<br>
She sat staring at the dumb tread of Time<br>
And the approach of ever-nearing Fate,<br>
A summons from her being’s summit came,<br>
A sound, a call that broke the seals of Night.<br>
Above her brows where will and knowledge meet<br>
A mighty Voice invaded mortal space.<br>
It seemed to come from inaccessible heights<br>
And yet was intimate with all the world<br>
And knew the meaning of the steps of Time<br>
And saw eternal destiny’s changeless scene<br>
Filling the far prospect of the cosmic gaze.<br>
As the Voice touched, her body became a stark<br>
And rigid golden statue of motionless trance,<br>
A stone of God lit by an amethyst soul.<br>
Around her body’s stillness all grew still:<br>
Her heart listened to its slow measured beats,<br>
Her mind renouncing thought heard and was mute:<br>
“Why camest thou to this dumb deathbound earth,<br>
This ignorant life beneath indifferent skies<br>
Tied like a sacrifice on the altar of Time,<br>
O spirit, O immortal energy,<br>
If ’twas to nurse grief in a helpless heart<br>
Or with hard tearless eyes await thy doom?<br>
Arise, O soul, and vanquish Time and Death.”<br>
But Savitri’s heart replied in the dim night:<br>
“My strength is taken from me and given to Death.<br>
Why should I lift my hands to the shut heavens<br>
Or struggle with mute inevitable Fate<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Parable of the Search for the Soul<br>
<br>
Or hope in vain to uplift an ignorant race<br>
Who hug their lot and mock the saviour Light<br>
And see in Mind wisdom’s sole tabernacle,<br>
In its harsh peak and its inconscient base<br>
A rock of safety and an anchor of sleep?<br>
Is there a God whom any cry can move?<br>
He sits in peace and leaves the mortal’s strength<br>
Impotent against his calm omnipotent Law<br>
And Inconscience and the almighty hands of Death.<br>
What need have I, what need has Satyavan<br>
To avoid the black-meshed net, the dismal door,<br>
Or call a mightier Light into life’s closed room,<br>
A greater Law into man’s little world?<br>
Why should I strive with earth’s unyielding laws<br>
Or stave off death’s inevitable hour?<br>
This surely is best to pactise with my fate<br>
And follow close behind my lover’s steps<br>
And pass through night from twilight to the sun<br>
Across the tenebrous river that divides<br>
The adjoining parishes of earth and heaven.<br>
Then could we lie inarmed breast upon breast,<br>
Untroubled by thought, untroubled by our hearts,<br>
Forgetting man and life and time and its hours,<br>
Forgetting eternity’s call, forgetting God.”<br>
The Voice replied: “Is this enough, O spirit?<br>
And what shall thy soul say when it wakes and knows<br>
The work was left undone for which it came?<br>
Or is this all for thy being born on earth<br>
Charged with a mandate from eternity,<br>
A listener to the voices of the years,<br>
A follower of the footprints of the gods,<br>
To pass and leave unchanged the old dusty laws?<br>
Shall there be no new tables, no new Word,<br>
No greater light come down upon the earth<br>
Delivering her from her unconsciousness,<br>
Man’s spirit from unalterable Fate?<br>
<br>

BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Cam’st thou not down to open the doors of Fate,<br>
The iron doors that seemed for ever closed,<br>
And lead man to Truth’s wide and golden road<br>
That runs through finite things to eternity?<br>
Is this then the report that I must make,<br>
My head bowed with shame before the Eternal’s seat, —<br>
His power he kindled in thy body has failed,<br>
His labourer returns, her task undone?”<br>
Then Savitri’s heart fell mute, it spoke no word.<br>
But holding back her troubled rebel heart,<br>
Abrupt, erect and strong, calm like a hill,<br>
Surmounting the seas of mortal ignorance,<br>
Its peak immutable above mind’s air,<br>
A Power within her answered the still Voice:<br>
“I am thy portion here charged with thy work,<br>
As thou myself seated for ever above,<br>
Speak to my depths, O great and deathless Voice,<br>
Command, for I am here to do thy will.”<br>
The Voice replied: “Remember why thou cam’st:<br>
Find out thy soul, recover thy hid self,<br>
In silence seek God’s meaning in thy depths,<br>
Then mortal nature change to the divine.<br>
Open God’s door, enter into his trance.<br>
Cast Thought from thee, that nimble ape of Light:<br>
In his tremendous hush stilling thy brain<br>
His vast Truth wake within and know and see.<br>
Cast from thee sense that veils thy spirit’s sight:<br>
In the enormous emptiness of thy mind<br>
Thou shalt see the Eternal’s body in the world,<br>
Know him in every voice heard by thy soul,<br>
In the world’s contacts meet his single touch;<br>
All things shall fold thee into his embrace.<br>
Conquer thy heart’s throbs, let thy heart beat in God:<br>
Thy nature shall be the engine of his works,<br>
Thy voice shall house the mightiness of his Word:<br>
Then shalt thou harbour my force and conquer Death.”<br>

Then Savitri by her doomed husband sat,<br>
Still rigid in her golden motionless pose,<br>
A statue of the fire of the inner sun.<br>
In the black night the wrath of storm swept by,<br>
The thunder crashed above her, the rain hissed,<br>
Its million footsteps pattered on the roof.<br>
Impassive mid the movement and the cry,<br>
Witness of the thoughts of mind, the moods of life,<br>
She looked into herself and sought for her soul.<br>
A dream disclosed to her the cosmic past,<br>
The crypt-seed and the mystic origins,<br>
The shadowy beginnings of world-fate:<br>
A lamp of symbol lighting hidden truth<br>
Imaged to her the world’s significance.<br>
In the indeterminate formlessness of Self<br>
Creation took its first mysterious steps,<br>
It made the body’s shape a house of soul<br>
And Matter learned to think and person grew;<br>
She saw Space peopled with the seeds of life<br>
And saw the human creature born in Time.<br>
At first appeared a dim half-neutral tide<br>
Of being emerging out of infinite Nought:<br>
A consciousness looked at the inconscient Vast<br>
And pleasure and pain stirred in the insensible Void.<br>
All was the deed of a blind World-Energy:<br>
Unconscious of her own exploits she worked,<br>
Shaping a universe out of the Inane.<br>
In fragmentary beings she grew aware:<br>
A chaos of little sensibilities<br>
Gathered round a small ego’s pin-point head;<br>
In it a sentient creature found its poise,<br>
It moved and lived a breathing, thinking whole.<br>
On a dim ocean of subconscient life<br>
A formless surface consciousness awoke:<br>
A stream of thoughts and feelings came and went,<br>
<br>
477<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
A foam of memories hardened and became<br>
A bright crust of habitual sense and thought,<br>
A seat of living personality<br>
And recurrent habits mimicked permanence.<br>
Mind nascent laboured out a mutable form,<br>
It built a mobile house on shifting sands,<br>
A floating isle upon a bottomless sea.<br>
A conscious being was by this labour made;<br>
It looked around it on its difficult field<br>
In the green wonderful and perilous earth;<br>
It hoped in a brief body to survive,<br>
Relying on Matter’s false eternity.<br>
It felt a godhead in its fragile house;<br>
It saw blue heavens, dreamed immortality.<br>
A conscious soul in the Inconscient’s world,<br>
Hidden behind our thoughts and hopes and dreams,<br>
An indifferent Master signing Nature’s acts<br>
Leaves the vicegerent mind a seeming king.<br>
In his floating house upon the sea of Time<br>
The regent sits at work and never rests:<br>
He is a puppet of the dance of Time;<br>
He is driven by the hours, the moment’s call<br>
Compels him with the thronging of life’s need<br>
And the babel of the voices of the world.<br>
This mind no silence knows nor dreamless sleep,<br>
In the incessant circling of its steps<br>
Thoughts tread for ever through the listening brain;<br>
It toils like a machine and cannot stop.<br>
Into the body’s many-storeyed rooms<br>
Endless crowd down the dream-god’s messages.<br>
All is a hundred-toned murmur and babble and stir,<br>
There is a tireless running to and fro,<br>
A haste of movement and a ceaseless cry.<br>

To every knock upon the outer doors,<br>
Bring in time’s visitors, report each call,<br>

And the messages of communicating minds<br>
And the heavy business of unnumbered lives<br>
And all the thousandfold commerce of the world.<br>
Even in the tracts of sleep is scant repose;<br>
He mocks life’s steps in strange subconscient dreams,<br>
He strays in a subtle realm of symbol scenes,<br>
His night with thin-air visions and dim forms<br>
He packs or peoples with slight drifting shapes<br>
And only a moment spends in silent Self.<br>
Adventuring into infinite mind-space<br>
He unfolds his wings of thought in inner air,<br>
Or travelling in imagination’s car<br>
Crosses the globe, journeys beneath the stars,<br>
To subtle worlds takes his ethereal course,<br>
Visits the Gods on Life’s miraculous peaks,<br>
Communicates with Heaven, tampers with Hell.<br>
This is the little surface of man’s life.<br>
He is this and he is all the universe;<br>
He scales the Unseen, his depths dare the Abyss;<br>
A whole mysterious world is locked within.<br>
Unknown to himself he lives a hidden king<br>
Behind rich tapestries in great secret rooms;<br>
An epicure of the spirit’s unseen joys,<br>
He lives on the sweet honey of solitude:<br>
A nameless god in an unapproachable fane,<br>
In the secret adytum of his inmost soul<br>
He guards the being’s covered mysteries<br>
Beneath the threshold, behind shadowy gates<br>
Or shut in vast cellars of inconscient sleep.<br>
The immaculate Divine All-Wonderful<br>
Casts into the argent purity of his soul<br>
His splendour and his greatness and the light<br>
Of self-creation in Time’s infinity<br>
As into a sublimely mirroring glass.<br>
Man in the world’s life works out the dreams of God.<br>

But all is there, even God’s opposites;<br>
He is a little front of Nature’s works,<br>
A thinking outline of a cryptic Force.<br>
All she reveals in him that is in her,<br>
Her glories walk in him and her darknesses.<br>
Man’s house of life holds not the gods alone:<br>
There are occult Shadows, there are tenebrous Powers,<br>
Inhabitants of life’s ominous nether rooms,<br>
A shadowy world’s stupendous denizens.<br>
A careless guardian of his nature’s powers,<br>

And the Beast grovels in his antre den:<br>
Dire mutterings rise and murmur in their drowse.<br>
Insurgent sometimes raises its huge head<br>
A monstrous mystery lurking in life’s deeps,<br>
The mystery of dark and fallen worlds,<br>
The dread visages of the adversary Kings.<br>
The dreadful powers held down within his depths<br>
Become his masters or his ministers;<br>
Enormous they invade his bodily house,<br>
Can act in his acts, infest his thought and life.<br>
Inferno surges into the human air<br>
And touches all with a perverting breath.<br>
Grey forces like a thin miasma creep,<br>
Stealing through chinks in his closed mansion’s doors,<br>
Discolouring the walls of upper mind<br>
In which he lives his fair and specious life,<br>
And leave behind a stench of sin and death:<br>
Not only rise in him perverse drifts of thought<br>
And formidable formless influences,<br>
But there come presences and awful shapes:<br>
Tremendous forms and faces mount dim steps<br>
And stare at times into his living-rooms,<br>
Or called up for a moment’s passionate work<br>

Afflicting the daylight and alarming night,<br>
Invading at will his outer tenement,<br>

Mounting into God’s light all light perturb.<br>
All they have touched or seen they make their own,<br>
In Nature’s basement lodge, mind’s passages fill,<br>
Disrupt thought’s links and musing sequences,<br>
Break through the soul’s stillness with a noise and cry<br>
Or they call the inhabitants of the abyss,<br>
Invite the instincts to forbidden joys,<br>
A laughter wake of dread demoniac mirth<br>
And with nether riot and revel shake life’s floor.<br>
Impotent to quell his terrible prisoners,<br>
Appalled the householder helpless sits above,<br>
Taken from him his house is his no more.<br>
He is bound and forced, a victim of the play,<br>
Or, allured, joys in the mad and mighty din.<br>
His nature’s dangerous forces have arisen<br>
And hold at will a rebel’s holiday.<br>
Aroused from the darkness where they crouched in the depths,<br>
Prisoned from the sight, they can be held no more;<br>

Into the earth-ways they break out from all doors,<br>
Invade with blood-lust and the will to slay<br>
And fill with horror and carnage God’s fair world.<br>
Death and his hunters stalk a victim earth;<br>
The terrible Angel smites at every door:<br>

A foreign inhabitant, a dangerous guest:<br>

Expel the householder, possess the house.<br>

Has straddled the straight path of Nature’s acts.<br>

This can abolish man, annul his world.<br>
But there is a guardian power, there are Hands that save,<br>
Calm eyes divine regard the human scene.<br>
All the world’s possibilities in man<br>
Are waiting as the tree waits in its seed:<br>
His past lives in him; it drives his future’s pace;<br>
His present’s acts fashion his coming fate.<br>
The unborn gods hide in his house of Life.<br>
The daemons of the unknown overshadow his mind<br>
Casting their dreams into live moulds of thought,<br>
The moulds in which his mind builds out its world.<br>
His mind creates around him its universe.<br>

All that can be is figured in his soul.<br>
Issuing in deeds it scores on the roads of the world,<br>
Obscure to the interpreting reason’s guess,<br>
Lines of the secret purpose of the gods.<br>

Finds out its settled poise and fated hour.<br>
Our surface watched in vain by reason’s gaze,<br>
Invaded by the impromptus of the unseen,<br>
Helpless records the accidents of Time,<br>
The involuntary turns and leaps of life.<br>
Only a little of us foresees its steps,<br>
Only a little has will and purposed pace.<br>
A vast subliminal is man’s measureless part.<br>
The dim subconscient is his cavern base.<br>
Abolished vainly in the walks of Time<br>
Our past lives still in our unconscious selves<br>
And by the weight of its hidden influences<br>
Is shaped our future’s self-discovery.<br>
Thus all is an inevitable chain<br>
And yet a series seems of accidents.<br>
The unremembering hours repeat the old acts,<br>
Our dead past round our future’s ankles clings<br>
And drags back the new nature’s glorious stride,<br>
Or from its buried corpse old ghosts arise,<br>
Old thoughts, old longings, dead passions live again,<br>
Recur in sleep or move the waking man<br>
To words that force the barrier of the lips,<br>
To deeds that suddenly start and o’erleap<br>
His head of reason and his guardian will.<br>
An old self lurks in the new self we are;<br>
Hardly we escape from what we once had been:<br>
In the dim gleam of habit’s passages,<br>
In the subconscient’s darkling corridors<br>
All things are carried by the porter nerves<br>
And nothing checked by subterranean mind,<br>
Unstudied by the guardians of the doors<br>
And passed by a blind instinctive memory,<br>
The old gang dismissed, old cancelled passports serve.<br>
Nothing is wholly dead that once had lived;<br>
In dim tunnels of the world’s being and in ours<br>
The old rejected nature still survives;<br>

He scattered formulas of omnipotence.<br>
Thus man in his little house made of earth’s dust<br>
Grew towards an unseen heaven of thought and dream<br>
Looking into the vast vistas of his mind<br>
On a small globe dotting infinity.<br>
At last climbing a long and narrow stair<br>
He stood alone on the high roof of things<br>
And saw the light of a spiritual sun.<br>
Aspiring he transcends his earthly self;<br>
He stands in the largeness of his soul new-born,<br>
Redeemed from encirclement by mortal things<br>
And moves in a pure free spiritual realm<br>

To mould humanity into God’s own shape<br>
And lead this great blind struggling world to light<br>
Or a new world discover or create.<br>

The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
AT FIRST out of the busy hum of mind<br>
As if from a loud thronged market into a cave<br>
By an inward moment’s magic she had come.<br>
A stark hushed emptiness became her self:<br>
Her mind unvisited by the voice of thought<br>
Stared at a void deep’s dumb infinity.<br>
Her heights receded, her depths behind her closed;<br>
All fled away from her and left her blank.<br>
But when she came back to her self of thought,<br>
Once more she was a human thing on earth,<br>
A lump of Matter, a house of closed sight,<br>
A mind compelled to think out ignorance,<br>
A life-force pressed into a camp of works<br>
And the material world her limiting field.<br>
Amazed like one unknowing she sought her way<br>
Out of the tangle of man’s ignorant past<br>
That took the surface person for the soul.<br>
Then a Voice spoke that dwelt on secret heights:<br>
“For man thou seekst, not for thyself alone.<br>
Only if God assumes the human mind<br>
And puts on mortal ignorance for his cloak<br>
And makes himself the Dwarf with triple stride,<br>
Can he help man to grow into the God.<br>
As man disguised the cosmic Greatness works<br>
And finds the mystic inaccessible gate<br>
And opens the Immortal’s golden door.<br>
Man, human, follows in God’s human steps.<br>
Accepting his darkness thou must bring to him light,<br>
Accepting his sorrow thou must bring to him bliss.<br>
In Matter’s body find thy heaven-born soul.”<br>
Then Savitri surged out of her body’s wall<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
And stood a little span outside herself<br>
And looked into her subtle being’s depths<br>
And in its heart as in a lotus-bud<br>
Divined her secret and mysterious soul.<br>
At the dim portal of the inner life<br>
That bars out from our depths the body’s mind<br>
And all that lives but by the body’s breath,<br>
She knocked and pressed against the ebony gate.<br>
The living portal groaned with sullen hinge:<br>
Heavily reluctant it complained inert<br>
Against the tyranny of the spirit’s touch.<br>
A formidable voice cried from within:<br>
“Back, creature of earth, lest tortured and torn thou die.”<br>
A dreadful murmur rose like a dim sea;<br>
The Serpent of the threshold hissing rose,<br>
A fatal guardian hood with monstrous coils,<br>
The hounds of darkness growled with jaws agape,<br>
And trolls and gnomes and goblins scowled and stared<br>
And wild beast roarings thrilled the blood with fear<br>
And menace muttered in a dangerous tongue.<br>
Unshaken her will pressed on the rigid bars:<br>
The gate swung wide with a protesting jar,<br>
The opponent Powers withdrew their dreadful guard;<br>
Her being entered into the inner worlds.<br>
In a narrow passage, the subconscient’s gate,<br>
She breathed with difficulty and pain and strove<br>
To find the inner self concealed in sense.<br>
Into a dense of subtle Matter packed,<br>
A cavity filled with a blind mass of power,<br>
An opposition of misleading gleams,<br>
A heavy barrier of unseeing sight,<br>
She forced her way through body to the soul.<br>
Across a perilous border line she passed<br>
Where Life dips into the subconscient dusk<br>
Or struggles from Matter into chaos of mind,<br>
Aswarm with elemental entities<br>

And fluttering shapes of vague half-bodied thought<br>
And crude beginnings of incontinent force.<br>

A press of uncertain powers and drifting wills;<br>
For all was there but nothing in its place.<br>
At times an opening came, a door was forced;<br>
She crossed through spaces of a secret self<br>
And trod in passages of inner Time.<br>
At last she broke into a form of things,<br>
A start of finiteness, a world of sense:<br>
But all was still confused, nothing self-found.<br>
Soul was not there but only cries of life.<br>
A thronged and clamorous air environed her.<br>
A horde of sounds defied significance,<br>
A dissonant clash of cries and contrary calls;<br>
A mob of visions broke across the sight,<br>
A jostled sequence lacking sense and suite,<br>
Feelings pushed through a packed and burdened heart,<br>
Each forced its separate inconsequent way<br>
But cared for nothing but its ego’s drive.<br>
A rally without key of common will,<br>
Thought stared at thought and pulled at the taut brain<br>
As if to pluck the reason from its seat<br>
And cast its corpse into life’s wayside drain;<br>
So might forgotten lie in Nature’s mud<br>
Abandoned the slain sentinel of the soul.<br>
So could life’s power shake from it mind’s rule,<br>
Nature renounce the spirit’s government<br>
And the bare elemental energies<br>
Make of the sense a glory of boundless joy,<br>
A splendour of ecstatic anarchy,<br>
A revel mighty and mad of utter bliss.<br>
This was the sense’s instinct void of soul<br>
Or when the soul sleeps hidden void of power,<br>
But now the vital godhead wakes within<br>
And lifts the life with the Supernal’s touch.<br>
<br>

<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
But how shall come the glory and the flame<br>
If mind is cast away into the abyss?<br>
For body without mind has not the light,<br>
The rapture of spirit sense, the joy of life;<br>
All then becomes subconscient, tenebrous,<br>
Inconscience puts its seal on Nature’s page<br>
Or else a mad disorder whirls the brain<br>
Posting along a ravaged nature’s roads,<br>
A chaos of disordered impulses<br>
In which no light can come, no joy, no peace.<br>
This state now threatened, this she pushed from her.<br>
As if in a long endless tossing street<br>
One driven mid a trampling hurrying crowd<br>
Hour after hour she trod without release<br>
Holding by her will the senseless meute at bay;<br>
Out of the dreadful press she dragged her will<br>
And fixed her thought upon the saviour Name;<br>
Then all grew still and empty; she was free.<br>
A large deliverance came, a vast calm space.<br>
Awhile she moved through a blank tranquillity<br>
Of naked Light from an invisible sun,<br>
A void that was a bodiless happiness,<br>
A blissful vacuum of nameless peace.<br>
But now a mightier danger’s front drew near:<br>
The press of bodily mind, the Inconscient’s brood<br>
Of aimless thought and will had fallen from her.<br>
Approaching loomed a giant head of Life<br>
Ungoverned by mind or soul, subconscient, vast.<br>
It tossed all power into a single drive,<br>
It made its power a might of dangerous seas.<br>
Into the stillness of her silent self,<br>
Into the whiteness of its muse of Space<br>
A spate, a torrent of the speed of Life<br>
Broke like a wind-lashed driven mob of waves<br>
Racing on a pale floor of summer sand;<br>
It drowned its banks, a mountain of climbing waves.<br>
<br>
491<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Enormous was its vast and passionate voice.<br>
It cried to her listening spirit as it ran,<br>
Demanding God’s submission to chainless Force.<br>
A deaf force calling to a status dumb,<br>
A thousand voices in a muted Vast,<br>
It claimed the heart’s support for its clutch at joy,<br>
For its need to act the witness Soul’s consent,<br>
For its lust of power her neutral being’s seal.<br>
Into the wideness of her watching self<br>
It brought a grandiose gust of the Breath of Life;<br>
Its torrent carried the world’s hopes and fears,<br>
All life’s, all Nature’s dissatisfied hungry cry,<br>
And the longing all eternity cannot fill.<br>
It called to the mountain secrecies of the soul<br>
And the miracle of the never-dying fire,<br>
It spoke to some first inexpressible ecstasy<br>
Hidden in the creative beat of Life;<br>
Out of the nether unseen deeps it tore<br>
Its lure and magic of disordered bliss,<br>
Into earth-light poured its maze of tangled charm<br>
And heady draught of Nature’s primitive joy<br>
And the fire and mystery of forbidden delight<br>
Drunk from the world-libido’s bottomless well,<br>
And the honey-sweet poison-wine of lust and death,<br>
But dreamed a vintage of glory of life’s gods,<br>
And felt as celestial rapture’s golden sting.<br>
The cycles of the infinity of desire<br>
And the mystique that made an unrealised world<br>
Wider than the known and closer than the unknown<br>
In which hunt for ever the hounds of mind and life,<br>
Tempted a deep dissatisfied urge within<br>
To long for the unfulfilled and ever far<br>
And make this life upon a limiting earth<br>
A climb towards summits vanishing in the void,<br>
A search for the glory of the impossible.<br>
It dreamed of that which never has been known,<br>
<br>
492<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
493<br>
<br>
It grasped at that which never has been won,<br>
It chased into an Elysian memory<br>
The charms that flee from the heart’s soon lost delight;<br>
It dared the force that slays, the joys that hurt,<br>
The imaged shape of unaccomplished things<br>
And the summons to a Circean transmuting dance<br>
And passion’s tenancy of the courts of love<br>
And the wild Beast’s ramp and romp with Beauty and Life.<br>
It brought its cry and surge of opposite powers,<br>
Its moments of the touch of luminous planes,<br>
Its flame-ascensions and sky-pitched vast attempts,<br>
Its fiery towers of dream built on the winds,<br>
Its sinkings towards the darkness and the abyss,<br>
Its honey of tenderness, its sharp wine of hate,<br>
Its changes of sun and cloud, of laughter and tears,<br>
Its bottomless danger-pits and swallowing gulfs,<br>
Its fear and joy and ecstasy and despair,<br>
Its occult wizardries, its simple lines<br>
And great communions and uplifting moves,<br>
Its faith in heaven, its intercourse with hell.<br>
These powers were not blunt with the dead weight of earth,<br>
They gave ambrosia’s taste and poison’s sting.<br>
There was an ardour in the gaze of Life<br>
That saw heaven blue in the grey air of Night:<br>
The impulses godward soared on passion’s wings.<br>
Mind’s quick-paced thoughts floated from their high necks,<br>
A glowing splendour as of an irised mane,<br>
A parure of pure intuition’s light;<br>
Its flame-foot gallop they could imitate:<br>
Mind’s voices mimicked inspiration’s stress,<br>
Its ictus of infallibility,<br>
Its speed and lightning heaven-leap of the Gods.<br>
A trenchant blade that shore the nets of doubt,<br>
Its sword of discernment seemed almost divine.<br>
Yet all that knowledge was a borrowed sun’s;<br>
The forms that came were not heaven’s native births:<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
An inner voice could speak the unreal’s Word;<br>
Its puissance dangerous and absolute<br>
Could mingle poison with the wine of God.<br>
On these high shining backs falsehood could ride;<br>
Truth lay with delight in error’s passionate arms<br>
Gliding downstream in a blithe gilded barge:<br>
She edged her ray with a magnificent lie.<br>
Here in Life’s nether realms all contraries meet;<br>
Truth stares and does her works with bandaged eyes<br>
And Ignorance is Wisdom’s patron here:<br>
Those galloping hooves in their enthusiast speed<br>
Could bear to a dangerous intermediate zone<br>
Where Death walks wearing a robe of deathless Life.<br>
Or they enter the valley of the wandering Gleam<br>
Whence, captives or victims of the specious Ray,<br>
Souls trapped in that region never can escape.<br>
Agents, not masters, they serve Life’s desires<br>
Toiling for ever in the snare of Time.<br>
Their bodies born out of some Nihil’s womb<br>
Ensnare the spirit in the moment’s dreams,<br>
Then perish vomiting the immortal soul<br>
Out of Matter’s belly into the sink of Nought.<br>
Yet some uncaught, unslain, can warily pass<br>
Carrying Truth’s image in the sheltered heart,<br>
Pluck Knowledge out of error’s screening grip,<br>
Break paths through the blind walls of little self,<br>
Then travel on to reach a greater life.<br>
All this streamed past her and seemed to her vision’s sight<br>
As if around a high and voiceless isle<br>
A clamour of waters from far unknown hills<br>
Swallowed its narrow banks in crowding waves<br>
And made a hungry world of white wild foam:<br>
Hastening, a dragon with a million feet,<br>
Its foam and cry a drunken giant’s din,<br>
Tossing a mane of Darkness into God’s sky,<br>
It ebbed receding into a distant roar.<br>
<br>
494<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
495<br>
<br>
Then smiled again a large and tranquil air:<br>
Blue heaven, green earth, partners of Beauty’s reign,<br>
Lived as of old, companions in happiness;<br>
And in the world’s heart laughed the joy of life.<br>
All now was still, the soil shone dry and pure.<br>
Through it all she moved not, plunged not in the vain waves.<br>
Out of the vastness of the silent self<br>
Life’s clamour fled; her spirit was mute and free.<br>
Then journeying forward through the self’s wide hush<br>
She came into a brilliant ordered Space.<br>
There Life dwelt parked in an armed tranquillity;<br>
A chain was on her strong insurgent heart.<br>
Tamed to the modesty of a measured pace,<br>
She kept no more her vehement stride and rush;<br>
She had lost the careless majesty of her muse<br>
And the ample grandeur of her regal force;<br>
Curbed were her mighty pomps, her splendid waste,<br>
Sobered the revels of her bacchant play,<br>
Cut down were her squanderings in desire’s bazaar,<br>
Coerced her despot will, her fancy’s dance,<br>
A cold stolidity bound the riot of sense.<br>
A royalty without freedom was her lot;<br>
The sovereign throned obeyed her ministers:<br>
Her servants mind and sense governed her house:<br>
Her spirit’s bounds they cast in rigid lines<br>
And guarding with a phalanx of armoured rules<br>
The reason’s balanced reign, kept order and peace.<br>
Her will lived closed in adamant walls of law,<br>
Coerced was her force by chains that feigned to adorn,<br>
Imagination was prisoned in a fort,<br>
Her wanton and licentious favourite;<br>
Reality’s poise and reason’s symmetry<br>
Were set in its place sentinelled by marshalled facts,<br>
They gave to the soul for throne a bench of Law,<br>
For kingdom a small world of rule and line:<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
The ages’ wisdom, shrivelled to scholiast lines,<br>
Shrank patterned into a copy-book device.<br>
The Spirit’s almighty freedom was not here:<br>
A schoolman mind had captured life’s large space,<br>
But chose to live in bare and paltry rooms<br>
Parked off from the too vast dangerous universe,<br>
Fearing to lose its soul in the infinite.<br>
Even the Idea’s ample sweep was cut<br>
Into a system, chained to fixed pillars of thought<br>
Or rivetted to Matter’s solid ground:<br>
Or else the soul was lost in its own heights:<br>
Obeying the Ideal’s high-browed law<br>
Thought based a throne on unsubstantial air<br>
Disdaining earth’s flat triviality:<br>
It barred reality out to live in its dreams.<br>
Or all stepped into a systemed universe:<br>
Life’s empire was a managed continent,<br>
Its thoughts an army ranked and disciplined;<br>
Uniformed they kept the logic of their fixed place<br>
At the bidding of the trained centurion mind.<br>
Or each stepped into its station like a star<br>
Or marched through fixed and constellated heavens<br>
Or kept its feudal rank among its peers<br>
In the sky’s unchanging cosmic hierarchy.<br>
Or like a high-bred maiden with chaste eyes<br>
Forbidden to walk unveiled the public ways,<br>
She must in close secluded chambers move,<br>
Her feeling in cloisters live or gardened paths.<br>
Life was consigned to a safe level path,<br>
It dared not tempt the great and difficult heights<br>
Or climb to be neighbour to a lonely star<br>
Or skirt the danger of the precipice<br>
Or tempt the foam-curled breakers’ perilous laugh,<br>
Adventure’s lyrist, danger’s amateur,<br>
Or into her chamber call some flaming god,<br>
Or leave the world’s bounds and where no limits are<br>
<br>
496<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
Meet with the heart’s passion the Adorable<br>
Or set the world ablaze with the inner Fire.<br>
A chastened epithet in the prose of life,<br>
She must fill with colour just her sanctioned space,<br>
Not break out of the cabin of the idea<br>
Nor trespass into rhythms too high or vast.<br>
Even when it soared into ideal air,<br>
Thought’s flight lost not itself in heaven’s blue:<br>
It drew upon the skies a patterned flower<br>
Of disciplined beauty and harmonic light.<br>
A temperate vigilant spirit governed life:<br>
Its acts were tools of the considering thought,<br>
Too cold to take fire and set the world ablaze,<br>
Or the careful reason’s diplomatic moves<br>
Testing the means to a prefigured end,<br>
Or at the highest pitch some calm Will’s plan<br>
Or a strategy of some High Command within<br>
To conquer the secret treasures of the gods<br>
Or win for a masked king some glorious world,<br>
Not a reflex of the spontaneous self,<br>
An index of the being and its moods,<br>
A winging of conscious spirit, a sacrament<br>
Of life’s communion with the still Supreme<br>
Or its pure movement on the Eternal’s road.<br>
Or else for the body of some high Idea<br>
A house was built with too close-fitting bricks;<br>
Action and thought cemented made a wall<br>
Of small ideals limiting the soul.<br>
Even meditation mused on a narrow seat;<br>
And worship turned to an exclusive God,<br>
To the Universal in a chapel prayed<br>
Whose doors were shut against the universe;<br>
Or kneeled to the bodiless Impersonal<br>
A mind shut to the cry and fire of love:<br>
A rational religion dried the heart.<br>
It planned a smooth life’s acts with ethics’ rule<br>
<br>
497<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Or offered a cold and flameless sacrifice.<br>
The sacred Book lay on its sanctified desk<br>
Wrapped in interpretation’s silken strings:<br>
A credo sealed up its spiritual sense.<br>
Here was a quiet country of fixed mind,<br>
Here life no more was all nor passion’s voice;<br>
The cry of sense had sunk into a hush.<br>
Soul was not there nor spirit but mind alone;<br>
Mind claimed to be the spirit and the soul.<br>
The spirit saw itself as form of mind,<br>
Lost itself in the glory of the thought,<br>
A light that made invisible the sun.<br>
Into a firm and settled space she came<br>
Where all was still and all things kept their place.<br>
Each found what it had sought and knew its aim.<br>
All had a final last stability.<br>
There one stood forth who bore authority<br>
On an important brow and held a rod;<br>
Command was incarnate in his gesture and tone;<br>
Tradition’s petrified wisdom carved his speech,<br>
His sentences savoured the oracle.<br>
“Traveller or pilgrim of the inner world,<br>
Fortunate art thou to reach our brilliant air<br>
Flaming with thought’s supreme finality.<br>
O aspirant to the perfect way of life,<br>
Here find it; rest from search and live at peace.<br>
Ours is the home of cosmic certainty.<br>
Here is the truth, God’s harmony is here.<br>
Register thy name in the book of the elite,<br>
Admitted by the sanction of the few,<br>
Adopt thy station of knowledge, thy post in mind,<br>
Thy ticket of order draw in Life’s bureau<br>
And praise thy fate that made thee one of ours.<br>
All here, docketed and tied, the mind can know,<br>
All schemed by law that God permits to life.<br>
<br>
498<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
This is the end and there is no beyond.<br>
Here is the safety of the ultimate wall,<br>
Here is the clarity of the sword of Light,<br>
Here is the victory of a single Truth,<br>
Here burns the diamond of flawless bliss.<br>
A favourite of Heaven and Nature live.”<br>
But to the too satisfied and confident sage<br>
Savitri replied casting into his world<br>
Sight’s deep release, the heart’s questioning inner voice:<br>
For here the heart spoke not, only clear daylight<br>
Of intellect reigned here, limiting, cold, precise.<br>
“Happy are they who in this chaos of things,<br>
This coming and going of the feet of Time,<br>
Can find the single Truth, the eternal Law:<br>
Untouched they live by hope and doubt and fear.<br>
Happy are men anchored on fixed belief<br>
In this uncertain and ambiguous world,<br>
Or who have planted in the heart’s rich soil<br>
One small grain of spiritual certitude.<br>
Happiest who stand on faith as on a rock.<br>
But I must pass leaving the ended search,<br>
Truth’s rounded outcome firm, immutable<br>
And this harmonic building of world-fact,<br>
This ordered knowledge of apparent things.<br>
Here I can stay not, for I seek my soul.”<br>
None answered in that bright contented world,<br>
Or only turned on their accustomed way<br>
Astonished to hear questioning in that air<br>
Or thoughts that could still turn to the Beyond.<br>
But some murmured, passers-by from kindred spheres:<br>
Each by his credo judged the thought she spoke.<br>
“Who then is this who knows not that the soul<br>
Is a least gland or a secretion’s fault<br>
Disquieting the sane government of the mind,<br>
Disordering the function of the brain,<br>
Or a yearning lodged in Nature’s mortal house<br>
<br>
499<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Or dream whispered in man’s cave of hollow thought<br>
Who would prolong his brief unhappy term<br>
Or cling to living in a sea of death?”<br>
But others, “Nay, it is her spirit she seeks.<br>
A splendid shadow of the name of God,<br>
A formless lustre from the Ideal’s realm,<br>
The Spirit is the Holy Ghost of Mind;<br>
But none has touched its limbs or seen its face.<br>
Each soul is the great Father’s crucified Son,<br>
Mind is that soul’s one parent, its conscious cause,<br>
The ground on which trembles a brief passing light,<br>
Mind, sole creator of the apparent world.<br>
All that is here is part of our own self;<br>
Our minds have made the world in which we live.”<br>
Another with mystic and unsatisfied eyes<br>
Who loved his slain belief and mourned its death,<br>
“Is there one left who seeks for a Beyond?<br>
Can still the path be found, opened the gate?”<br>
So she fared on across her silent self.<br>
To a road she came thronged with an ardent crowd<br>
Who sped brilliant, fire-footed, sunlight-eyed,<br>
Pressing to reach the world’s mysterious wall,<br>
And pass through masked doorways into outer mind<br>
Where the Light comes not nor the mystic voice,<br>
Messengers from our subliminal greatnesses,<br>
Guests from the cavern of the secret soul.<br>
Into dim spiritual somnolence they break<br>
Or shed wide wonder on our waking self,<br>
Ideas that haunt us with their radiant tread,<br>
Dreams that are hints of unborn Reality,<br>
Strange goddesses with deep-pooled magical eyes,<br>
Strong wind-haired gods carrying the harps of hope,<br>
Great moon-hued visions gliding through gold air,<br>
Aspiration’s sun-dream head and star-carved limbs,<br>
Emotions making common hearts sublime.<br>
<br>
500<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Entry into the Inner Countries<br>
<br>
And Savitri mingling in that glorious crowd,<br>
Yearning to the spiritual light they bore,<br>
Longed once to hasten like them to save God’s world;<br>
But she reined back the high passion in her heart;<br>
She knew that first she must discover her soul.<br>
Only who save themselves can others save.<br>
In contrary sense she faced life’s riddling truth:<br>
They carrying the light to suffering men<br>
Hurried with eager feet to the outer world;<br>
Her eyes were turned towards the eternal source.<br>
Outstretching her hands to stay the throng she cried:<br>
“O happy company of luminous gods,<br>
Reveal, who know, the road that I must tread, —<br>
For surely that bright quarter is your home, —<br>
To find the birthplace of the occult Fire<br>
And the deep mansion of my secret soul.”<br>
One answered pointing to a silence dim<br>
On a remote extremity of sleep<br>
In some far background of the inner world.<br>
“O Savitri, from thy hidden soul we come.<br>
We are the messengers, the occult gods<br>
Who help men’s drab and heavy ignorant lives<br>
To wake to beauty and the wonder of things<br>
Touching them with glory and divinity;<br>
In evil we light the deathless flame of good<br>
And hold the torch of knowledge on ignorant roads;<br>
We are thy will and all men’s will towards Light.<br>
O human copy and disguise of God<br>
Who seekst the deity thou keepest hid<br>
And livest by the Truth thou hast not known,<br>
Follow the world’s winding highway to its source.<br>
There in the silence few have ever reached,<br>
Thou shalt see the Fire burning on the bare stone<br>
And the deep cavern of thy secret soul.”<br>
Then Savitri following the great winding road<br>
Came where it dwindled into a narrow path<br>
<br>

BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>

502<br>
<br>
Trod only by rare wounded pilgrim feet.<br>
A few bright forms emerged from unknown depths<br>
And looked at her with calm immortal eyes.<br>
There was no sound to break the brooding hush;<br>
One felt the silent nearness of the soul.<br>
END OF CANTO THREE<br>
<br>
Canto Four<br>
<br>
The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
HERE from a low and prone and listless ground<br>
The passion of the first ascent began;<br>
A moon-bright face in a sombre cloud of hair,<br>
A Woman sat in a pale lustrous robe.<br>
A rugged and ragged soil was her bare seat,<br>
Beneath her feet a sharp and wounding stone.<br>
A divine pity on the peaks of the world,<br>
A spirit touched by the grief of all that lives,<br>
She looked out far and saw from inner mind<br>
This questionable world of outward things,<br>
Of false appearances and plausible shapes,<br>
This dubious cosmos stretched in the ignorant Void,<br>
The pangs of earth, the toil and speed of the stars<br>
And the difficult birth and dolorous end of life.<br>
Accepting the universe as her body of woe,<br>
The Mother of the seven sorrows bore<br>
The seven stabs that pierced her bleeding heart:<br>
The beauty of sadness lingered on her face,<br>
Her eyes were dim with the ancient stain of tears.<br>
Her heart was riven with the world’s agony<br>
And burdened with the sorrow and struggle in Time,<br>
An anguished music trailed in her rapt voice.<br>
Absorbed in a deep compassion’s ecstasy,<br>
Lifting the mild ray of her patient gaze,<br>
In soft sweet training words slowly she spoke:<br>
“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.<br>
To share the suffering of the world I came,<br>
I draw my children’s pangs into my breast.<br>
I am the nurse of the dolour beneath the stars;<br>
I am the soul of all who wailing writhe<br>
Under the ruthless harrow of the Gods.<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
I am woman, nurse and slave and beaten beast;<br>
I tend the hands that gave me cruel blows.<br>
The hearts that spurned my love and zeal I serve;<br>
I am the courted queen, the pampered doll,<br>
I am the giver of the bowl of rice,<br>
I am the worshipped Angel of the House.<br>
I am in all that suffers and that cries.<br>
Mine is the prayer that climbs in vain from earth,<br>
I am traversed by my creatures’ agonies,<br>
I am the spirit in a world of pain.<br>
The scream of tortured flesh and tortured hearts<br>
Fall’n back on heart and flesh unheard by Heaven<br>
Has rent with helpless grief and wrath my soul.<br>
I have seen the peasant burning in his hut,<br>
I have seen the slashed corpse of the slaughtered child,<br>
Heard woman’s cry ravished and stripped and haled<br>
Amid the bayings of the hell-hound mob,<br>
I have looked on, I had no power to save.<br>
I have brought no arm of strength to aid or slay;<br>
God gave me love, he gave me not his force.<br>
I have shared the toil of the yoked animal drudge<br>
Pushed by the goad, encouraged by the whip;<br>
I have shared the fear-filled life of bird and beast,<br>
Its long hunt for the day’s precarious food,<br>
Its covert slink and crouch and hungry prowl,<br>
Its pain and terror seized by beak and claw.<br>
I have shared the daily life of common men,<br>
Its petty pleasures and its petty cares,<br>
Its press of troubles and haggard horde of ills,<br>
Earth’s trail of sorrow hopeless of relief,<br>
The unwanted tedious labour without joy,<br>
And the burden of misery and the strokes of fate.<br>
I have been pity, leaning over pain<br>
And the tender smile that heals the wounded heart<br>
And sympathy making life less hard to bear.<br>
Man has felt near my unseen face and hands;<br>
<br>
504<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
I have become the sufferer and his moan,<br>
I have lain down with the mangled and the slain,<br>
I have lived with the prisoner in his dungeon cell.<br>
Heavy on my shoulders weighs the yoke of Time:<br>
Nothing refusing of creation’s load,<br>
I have borne all and know I still must bear:<br>
Perhaps when the world sinks into a last sleep,<br>
I too may sleep in dumb eternal peace.<br>
I have borne the calm indifference of Heaven,<br>
Watched Nature’s cruelty to suffering things<br>
While God passed silent by nor turned to help.<br>
Yet have I cried not out against his will,<br>
Yet have I not accused his cosmic Law.<br>
Only to change this great hard world of pain<br>
A patient prayer has risen from my breast;<br>
A pallid resignation lights my brow,<br>
Within me a blind faith and mercy dwell;<br>
I carry the fire that never can be quenched<br>
And the compassion that supports the suns.<br>
I am the hope that looks towards my God,<br>
My God who never came to me till now;<br>
His voice I hear that ever says ‘I come’:<br>
I know that one day he shall come at last.”<br>
She ceased, and like an echo from below<br>
Answering her pathos of divine complaint<br>
A voice of wrath took up the dire refrain,<br>
A growl of thunder or roar of angry beast,<br>
The beast that crouching growls within man’s depths, —<br>
Voice of a tortured Titan once a God.<br>
“I am the Man of Sorrows, I am he<br>
Who is nailed on the wide cross of the universe;<br>
To enjoy my agony God built the earth,<br>
My passion he has made his drama’s theme.<br>
He has sent me naked into his bitter world<br>
And beaten me with his rods of grief and pain<br>
That I might cry and grovel at his feet<br>

In the flame he kindled burning like a moth;<br>
I am the seeker who can never find,<br>
I am the fighter who can never win,<br>
I am the runner who never touched his goal:<br>
Hell tortures me with the edges of my thought,<br>
Heaven tortures me with the splendour of my dreams.<br>
What profit have I of my animal birth;<br>
What profit have I of my human soul?<br>
I toil like the animal, like the animal die.<br>
I am man the rebel, man the helpless serf;<br>
Fate and my fellows cheat me of my wage.<br>
I loosen with my blood my servitude’s seal<br>
And shake from my aching neck the oppressor’s knees<br>
Only to seat new tyrants on my back:<br>
My teachers lesson me in slavery,<br>
I am shown God’s stamp and my own signature<br>
Upon the sorry contract of my fate.<br>
I have loved, but none has loved me since my birth;<br>
My fruit of works is given to other hands.<br>
All that is left me is my evil thoughts,<br>
My sordid quarrel against God and man,<br>
Envy of the riches that I cannot share,<br>
Hate of a happiness that is not mine.<br>
I know my fate will ever be the same,<br>
It is my nature’s work that cannot change:<br>
I have loved for mine, not for the beloved’s sake,<br>
I have lived for myself and not for others’ lives.<br>
Each in himself is sole by Nature’s law.<br>
So God has made his harsh and dreadful world,<br>
So has he built the petty heart of man.<br>
Only by force and ruse can man survive:<br>
For pity is a weakness in his breast,<br>
His goodness is a laxity in the nerves,<br>
<br>
506<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
His kindness an investment for return,<br>
His altruism is ego’s other face:<br>
He serves the world that him the world may serve.<br>
If once the Titan’s strength could wake in me,<br>
If Enceladus from Etna could arise,<br>
I then would reign the master of the world<br>
And like a god enjoy man’s bliss and pain.<br>
But God has taken from me the ancient Force.<br>
There is a dull consent in my sluggish heart,<br>
A fierce satisfaction with my special pangs<br>
As if they made me taller than my kind;<br>
Only by suffering can I excel.<br>
I am the victim of titanic ills,<br>
I am the doer of demoniac deeds;<br>
I was made for evil, evil is my lot;<br>
Evil I must be and by evil live;<br>
Nought other can I do but be myself;<br>
What Nature made me, that I must remain.<br>
I suffer and toil and weep; I moan and hate.”<br>
And Savitri heard the voice, the echo heard<br>
And turning to her being of pity spoke:<br>
“Madonna of suffering, Mother of grief divine,<br>
Thou art a portion of my soul put forth<br>
To bear the unbearable sorrow of the world.<br>
Because thou art, men yield not to their doom,<br>
But ask for happiness and strive with fate;<br>
Because thou art, the wretched still can hope.<br>
But thine is the power to solace, not to save.<br>
One day I will return, a bringer of strength,<br>
And make thee drink from the Eternal’s cup;<br>
His streams of force shall triumph in thy limbs<br>
And Wisdom’s calm control thy passionate heart.<br>
Thy love shall be the bond of humankind,<br>
Compassion the bright key of Nature’s acts:<br>
Misery shall pass abolished from the earth;<br>
The world shall be freed from the anger of the Beast,<br>
<br>
507<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
From the cruelty of the Titan and his pain.<br>
There shall be peace and joy for ever more.”<br>
On passed she in her spirit’s upward route.<br>
An ardent grandeur climbed mid ferns and rocks,<br>
A quiet wind flattered the heart to warmth,<br>
A finer perfume breathed from slender trees.<br>
All beautiful grew, subtle and high and strange.<br>
Here on a boulder carved like a huge throne<br>
A Woman sat in gold and purple sheen,<br>
Armed with the trident and the thunderbolt,<br>
Her feet upon a couchant lion’s back.<br>
A formidable smile curved round her lips,<br>
Heaven-fire laughed in the corners of her eyes;<br>
Her body a mass of courage and heavenly strength,<br>
She menaced the triumph of the nether gods.<br>
A halo of lightnings flamed around her head<br>
And sovereignty, a great cestus, zoned her robe<br>
And majesty and victory sat with her<br>
Guarding in the wide cosmic battlefield<br>
Against the flat equality of Death<br>
And the all-levelling insurgent Night<br>
The hierarchy of the ordered Powers,<br>
The high changeless values, the peaked eminences,<br>
The privileged aristocracy of Truth,<br>
And in the governing Ideal’s sun<br>
The triumvirate of wisdom, love and bliss<br>
And the sole autocracy of the absolute Light.<br>
August on her seat in the inner world of Mind,<br>
The Mother of Might looked down on passing things,<br>
Listened to the advancing tread of Time,<br>
Saw the irresistible wheeling of the suns<br>
And heard the thunder of the march of God.<br>
Amid the swaying Forces in their strife<br>
Sovereign was her word of luminous command,<br>
Her speech like a war-cry rang or a pilgrim chant.<br>
<br>
508<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
A charm restoring hope in failing hearts<br>
Aspired the harmony of her puissant voice:<br>
“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.<br>
I have come down into the human world<br>
And the movement watched by an unsleeping Eye<br>
And the dark contrariety of earth’s fate<br>
And the battle of the bright and sombre Powers.<br>
I stand upon earth’s paths of danger and grief<br>
And help the unfortunate and save the doomed.<br>
To the strong I bring the guerdon of their strength,<br>
To the weak I bring the armour of my force;<br>
To men who long I carry their coveted joy:<br>
I am fortune justifying the great and wise<br>
By the sanction of the plaudits of the crowd,<br>
Then trampling them with the armed heel of fate.<br>
My ear is leaned to the cry of the oppressed,<br>
I topple down the thrones of tyrant kings:<br>
A cry comes from proscribed and hunted lives<br>
Appealing to me against a pitiless world,<br>
A voice of the forsaken and desolate<br>
And the lone prisoner in his dungeon cell.<br>
Men hail in my coming the Almighty’s force<br>
Or praise with thankful tears his saviour Grace.<br>
I smite the Titan who bestrides the world<br>
And slay the ogre in his blood-stained den.<br>
I am Durga, goddess of the proud and strong,<br>
And Lakshmi, queen of the fair and fortunate;<br>
I wear the face of Kali when I kill,<br>
I trample the corpses of the demon hordes.<br>
I am charged by God to do his mighty work,<br>
Uncaring I serve his will who sent me forth,<br>
Reckless of peril and earthly consequence.<br>
I reason not of virtue and of sin<br>
But do the deed he has put into my heart.<br>
I fear not for the angry frown of Heaven,<br>
I flinch not from the red assault of Hell;<br>
<br>
509<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
I crush the opposition of the gods,<br>
Tread down a million goblin obstacles.<br>
I guide man to the path of the Divine<br>
And guard him from the red Wolf and the Snake.<br>
I set in his mortal hand my heavenly sword<br>
And put on him the breastplate of the gods.<br>
I break the ignorant pride of human mind<br>
And lead the thought to the wideness of the Truth;<br>
I rend man’s narrow and successful life<br>
And force his sorrowful eyes to gaze at the sun<br>
That he may die to earth and live in his soul.<br>
I know the goal, I know the secret route;<br>
I have studied the map of the invisible worlds;<br>
I am the battle’s head, the journey’s star.<br>
But the great obstinate world resists my Word,<br>
And the crookedness and evil in man’s heart<br>
Is stronger than Reason, profounder than the Pit,<br>
And the malignancy of hostile Powers<br>
Puts craftily back the clock of destiny<br>
And mightier seems than the eternal Will.<br>
The cosmic evil is too deep to unroot,<br>
The cosmic suffering is too vast to heal.<br>
A few I guide who pass me towards the Light;<br>
A few I save, the mass falls back unsaved;<br>
A few I help, the many strive and fail.<br>
But my heart I have hardened and I do my work:<br>
Slowly the light grows greater in the East,<br>
Slowly the world progresses on God’s road.<br>
His seal is on my task, it cannot fail:<br>
I shall hear the silver swing of heaven’s gates<br>
When God comes out to meet the soul of the world.”<br>
She spoke and from the lower human world<br>
An answer, a warped echo met her speech;<br>
The voice came through the spaces of the mind<br>
Of the dwarf-Titan, the deformed chained god<br>
Who strives to master his nature’s rebel stuff<br>
<br>
510<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
And make the universe his instrument.<br>
The Ego of this great world of desire<br>
Claimed earth and the wide heavens for the use<br>
Of man, head of the life it shapes on earth,<br>
Its representative and conscious soul,<br>
And symbol of evolving light and force<br>
And vessel of the godhead that must be.<br>
A thinking animal, Nature’s struggling lord,<br>
Has made of her his nurse and tool and slave<br>
And pays to her as wage and emolument<br>
Inescapably by a deep law in things<br>
His heart’s grief and his body’s death and pain:<br>
His pains are her means to grow, to see and feel;<br>
His death assists her immortality.<br>
A tool and slave of his own slave and tool,<br>
He praises his free will and his master mind<br>
And is pushed by her upon her chosen paths;<br>
Possessor he is possessed and, ruler, ruled,<br>
Her conscious automaton, her desire’s dupe.<br>
His soul is her guest, a sovereign mute, inert,<br>
His body her robot, his life her way to live,<br>
His conscious mind her strong revolted serf.<br>
The voice rose up and smote some inner sun.<br>
“I am the heir of the forces of the earth,<br>
Slowly I make good my right to my estate;<br>
A growing godhead in her divinised mud,<br>
I climb, a claimant to the throne of heaven.<br>
The last-born of the earth I stand the first;<br>
Her slow millenniums waited for my birth.<br>
Although I live in Time besieged by Death,<br>
Precarious owner of my body and soul<br>
Housed on a little speck amid the stars,<br>
For me and my use the universe was made.<br>
Immortal spirit in the perishing clay,<br>
I am God still unevolved in human form;<br>
Even if he is not, he becomes in me.<br>

BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
The sun and moon are lights upon my path;<br>
Air was invented for my lungs to breathe,<br>
Conditioned as a wide and wall-less space<br>
For my winged chariot’s wheels to cleave a road,<br>
The sea was made for me to swim and sail<br>
And bear my golden commerce on its back:<br>
It laughs cloven by my pleasure’s gliding keel,<br>
I laugh at its black stare of fate and death.<br>
The earth is my floor, the sky my living’s roof.<br>
All was prepared through many a silent age,<br>
God made experiments with animal shapes,<br>
Then only when all was ready I was born.<br>
I was born weak and small and ignorant,<br>
A helpless creature in a difficult world<br>
Travelling through my brief years with death at my side;<br>
I have grown greater than Nature, wiser than God.<br>
I have made real what she never dreamed,<br>
I have seized her powers and harnessed for my work,<br>
I have shaped her metals and new metals made;<br>
I will make glass and raiment out of milk,<br>
Make iron velvet, water unbreakable stone,<br>
Like God in his astuce of artist skill,<br>
Mould from one primal plasm protean forms,<br>
In single Nature multitudinous lives,<br>
All that imagination can conceive<br>
In mind intangible, remould anew<br>
In Matter’s plastic solid and concrete.<br>
No magic can surpass my magic’s skill.<br>
There is no miracle I shall not achieve.<br>
What God imperfect left, I will complete,<br>
Out of a tangled mind and half-made soul<br>
His sin and error I will eliminate;<br>
What he invented not, I shall invent:<br>
He was the first creator, I am the last.<br>
I have found the atoms from which he built the worlds:<br>
The first tremendous cosmic energy<br>

Missioned shall leap to slay my enemy kin,<br>
Expunge a nation or abolish a race,<br>
Death’s silence leave where there was laughter and joy.<br>
Or the fissured invisible shall spend God’s force<br>
To extend my comforts and expand my wealth,<br>
To speed my car which now the lightnings drive<br>
And turn the engines of my miracles.<br>
I will take his means of sorcery from his hands<br>
And do with them greater wonders than his best.<br>
Yet through it all I have kept my balanced thought;<br>
I have studied my being, I have examined the world,<br>
I have grown a master of the arts of life.<br>
I have tamed the wild beast, trained to be my friend;<br>
He guards my house, looks up waiting my will.<br>
I have taught my kind to serve and to obey.<br>
I have used the mystery of the cosmic waves<br>
To see far distance and to hear far words;<br>
I have conquered Space and knitted close all earth.<br>
Soon I shall know the secrets of the Mind;<br>
I play with knowledge and with ignorance<br>
And sin and virtue my inventions are<br>
I can transcend or sovereignly use.<br>
I shall know mystic truths, seize occult powers.<br>
I shall slay my enemies with a look or thought,<br>
I shall sense the unspoken feelings of all hearts<br>
And see and hear the hidden thoughts of men.<br>
When earth is mastered, I shall conquer heaven;<br>
The gods shall be my aides or menial folk,<br>
No wish I harbour unfulfilled shall die:<br>
Omnipotence and omniscience shall be mine.”<br>
And Savitri heard the voice, the warped echo heard<br>
And turning to her being of power she spoke:<br>
“Madonna of might, Mother of works and force,<br>
Thou art a portion of my soul put forth<br>
To help mankind and help the travail of Time.<br>
Because thou art in him, man hopes and dares;<br>
<br>
513<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
514<br>
<br>
Because thou art, men’s souls can climb the heavens<br>
And walk like gods in the presence of the Supreme.<br>
But without wisdom power is like a wind,<br>
It can breathe upon the heights and kiss the sky,<br>
It cannot build the extreme eternal things.<br>
Thou hast given men strength, wisdom thou couldst not give.<br>
One day I will return, a bringer of light;<br>
Then will I give to thee the mirror of God;<br>
Thou shalt see self and world as by him they are seen<br>
Reflected in the bright pool of thy soul.<br>
Thy wisdom shall be vast as vast thy power.<br>
Then hate shall dwell no more in human hearts,<br>
And fear and weakness shall desert men’s lives,<br>
The cry of the ego shall be hushed within,<br>
Its lion roar that claims the world as food,<br>
All shall be might and bliss and happy force.”<br>
Ascending still her spirit’s upward route<br>
She came into a high and happy space,<br>
A wide tower of vision whence all could be seen<br>
And all was centred in a single view<br>
As when by distance separate scenes grow one<br>
And a harmony is made of hues at war.<br>
The wind was still and fragrance packed the air.<br>
There was a carol of birds and murmur of bees,<br>
And all that is common and natural and sweet,<br>
Yet intimately divine to heart and soul.<br>
A nearness thrilled of the spirit to its source<br>
And deepest things seemed obvious, close and true.<br>
Here, living centre of that vision of peace,<br>
A Woman sat in clear and crystal light:<br>
Heaven had unveiled its lustre in her eyes,<br>
Her feet were moonbeams, her face was a bright sun,<br>
Her smile could persuade a dead lacerated heart<br>
To live again and feel the hands of calm.<br>
A low music heard became her floating voice:<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
“O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.<br>
I have come down to the wounded desolate earth<br>
To heal her pangs and lull her heart to rest<br>
And lay her head upon the Mother’s lap<br>
That she may dream of God and know his peace<br>
And draw the harmony of higher spheres<br>
Into the rhythm of earth’s rude troubled days.<br>
I show to her the figures of bright gods<br>
And bring strength and solace to her struggling life;<br>
High things that now are only words and forms<br>
I reveal to her in the body of their power.<br>
I am peace that steals into man’s war-worn breast,<br>
Amid the reign of Hell his acts create<br>
A hostel where Heaven’s messengers can lodge;<br>
I am charity with the kindly hands that bless,<br>
I am silence mid the noisy tramp of life;<br>
I am Knowledge poring on her cosmic map.<br>
In the anomalies of the human heart<br>
Where Good and Evil are close bedfellows<br>
And Light is by Darkness dogged at every step,<br>
Where his largest knowledge is an ignorance,<br>
I am the Power that labours towards the best<br>
And works for God and looks up towards the heights.<br>
I make even sin and error stepping-stones<br>
And all experience a long march towards Light.<br>
Out of the Inconscient I build consciousness,<br>
And lead through death to reach immortal Life.<br>
Many are God’s forms by which he grows in man;<br>
They stamp his thoughts and deeds with divinity,<br>
Uplift the stature of the human clay<br>
Or slowly transmute it into heaven’s gold.<br>
He is the Good for which men fight and die,<br>
He is the war of Right with Titan wrong;<br>
He is Freedom rising deathless from her pyre;<br>
He is Valour guarding still the desperate pass<br>
Or lone and erect on the shattered barricade<br>

<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Or a sentinel in the dangerous echoing Night.<br>
He is the crown of the martyr burned in flame<br>
And the glad resignation of the saint<br>
And courage indifferent to the wounds of Time<br>
And the hero’s might wrestling with death and fate.<br>
He is Wisdom incarnate on a glorious throne<br>
And the calm autocracy of the sage’s rule.<br>
He is the high and solitary Thought<br>
Aloof above the ignorant multitude:<br>
He is the prophet’s voice, the sight of the seer.<br>
He is Beauty, nectar of the passionate soul,<br>
He is the Truth by which the spirit lives.<br>
He is the riches of the spiritual Vast<br>
Poured out in healing streams on indigent Life;<br>
He is Eternity lured from hour to hour,<br>
He is infinity in a little space:<br>
He is immortality in the arms of death.<br>
These powers I am and at my call they come.<br>
Thus slowly I lift man’s soul nearer the Light.<br>
But human mind clings to its ignorance<br>
And to its littleness the human heart<br>
And to its right to grief the earthly life.<br>
Only when Eternity takes Time by the hand,<br>
Only when infinity weds the finite’s thought,<br>
Can man be free from himself and live with God.<br>
I bring meanwhile the gods upon the earth;<br>
I bring back hope to the despairing heart;<br>
I give peace to the humble and the great,<br>
And shed my grace on the foolish and the wise.<br>
I shall save earth, if earth consents to be saved.<br>
Then Love shall at last unwounded tread earth’s soil;<br>
Man’s mind shall admit the sovereignty of Truth<br>
And body bear the immense descent of God.”<br>
She spoke and from the ignorant nether plane<br>
A cry, a warped echo naked and shuddering came.<br>
A voice of the sense-shackled human mind<br>
<br>

<br>
CANTO IV: The Triple Soul-Forces<br>
<br>
Carried its proud complaint of godlike power<br>
Hedged by the limits of a mortal’s thoughts,<br>
Bound in the chains of earthly ignorance.<br>
Imprisoned in his body and his brain<br>
The mortal cannot see God’s mighty whole,<br>
Or share in his vast and deep identity<br>
Who stands unguessed within our ignorant hearts<br>
And knows all things because he is one with all.<br>
Man only sees the cosmic surfaces.<br>
Then wondering what may lie hid from the sense<br>
A little way he delves to depths below:<br>
But soon he stops, he cannot reach life’s core<br>
Or commune with the throbbing heart of things.<br>
He sees the naked body of the Truth<br>
Though often baffled by her endless garbs,<br>
But cannot look upon her soul within.<br>
Then, furious for a knowledge absolute,<br>
He tears all details out and stabs and digs:<br>
Only the shape’s contents he holds for use;<br>
The spirit escapes or dies beneath his knife.<br>
He sees as a blank stretch, a giant waste<br>
The crowding riches of infinity.<br>
The finite he has made his central field,<br>
Its plan dissects, masters its processes,<br>
That which moves all is hidden from his gaze,<br>
His poring eyes miss the unseen behind.<br>
He has the blind man’s subtle unerring touch<br>
Or the slow traveller’s sight of distant scenes;<br>
The soul’s revealing contacts are not his.<br>
Yet is he visited by intuitive light<br>
And inspiration comes from the Unknown;<br>
But only reason and sense he feels as sure,<br>
They only are his trusted witnesses.<br>
Thus is he baulked, his splendid effort vain;<br>
His knowledge scans bright pebbles on the shore<br>
Of the huge ocean of his ignorance.<br>

Yet grandiose were the accents of that cry,<br>
A cosmic pathos trembled in its tone.<br>
“I am the mind of God’s great ignorant world<br>
Ascending to knowledge by the steps he made;<br>
I am the all-discovering Thought of man.<br>
I am a god fettered by Matter and sense,<br>
An animal prisoned in a fence of thorns,<br>
A beast of labour asking for his food,<br>
A smith tied to his anvil and his forge.<br>
Yet have I loosened the cord, enlarged my room.<br>
I have mapped the heavens and analysed the stars,<br>
Described their orbits through the grooves of Space,<br>
Measured the miles that separate the suns,<br>
Computed their longevity in Time.<br>
I have delved into earth’s bowels and torn out<br>
The riches guarded by her dull brown soil.<br>
I have classed the changes of her stony crust<br>
And of her biography discovered the dates,<br>
Rescued the pages of all Nature’s plan.<br>
The tree of evolution I have sketched,<br>
Each branch and twig and leaf in its own place,<br>
In the embryo tracked the history of forms,<br>
And the genealogy framed of all that lives.<br>
I have detected plasm and cell and gene,<br>
The protozoa traced, man’s ancestors,<br>
The humble originals from whom he rose;<br>
I know how he was born and how he dies:<br>
Only what end he serves I know not yet<br>
Or if there is aim at all or any end<br>
Or push of rich creative purposeful joy<br>
In the wide works of the terrestrial power.<br>
I have caught her intricate processes, none is left:<br>
Her huge machinery is in my hands;<br>
I have seized the cosmic energies for my use.<br>
I have pored on her infinitesimal elements<br>
And her invisible atoms have unmasked:<br>

All Matter is a book I have perused;<br>
Only some pages now are left to read.<br>
I have seen the ways of life, the paths of mind;<br>
I have studied the methods of the ant and ape<br>
And the behaviour learned of man and worm.<br>
If God is at work, his secrets I have found.<br>
But still the Cause of things is left in doubt,<br>
Their truth flees from pursuit into a void;<br>
When all has been explained nothing is known.<br>
What chose the process, whence the Power sprang<br>
I know not and perhaps shall never know.<br>
A mystery is this mighty Nature’s birth;<br>
A mystery is the elusive stream of mind,<br>
A mystery the protean freak of life.<br>
What I have learned, Chance leaps to contradict;<br>
What I have built is seized and torn by Fate.<br>
I can foresee the acts of Matter’s force,<br>
But not the march of the destiny of man:<br>
He is driven upon paths he did not choose,<br>
He falls trampled underneath the rolling wheels.<br>
My great philosophies are a reasoned guess;<br>
The mystic heavens that claim the human soul<br>
Are a charlatanism of the imagining brain:<br>
All is a speculation or a dream.<br>
In the end the world itself becomes a doubt:<br>
The infinitesimal’s jest mocks mass and shape,<br>
A laugh peals from the infinite’s finite mask.<br>
Perhaps the world is an error of our sight,<br>
A trick repeated in each flash of sense,<br>
An unreal mind hallucinates the soul<br>
With a stress-vision of false reality,<br>
Or a dance of Maya veils the void Unborn.<br>
Even if a greater consciousness I could reach,<br>
What profit is it then for Thought to win<br>
A Real which is for ever ineffable<br>
Or hunt to its lair the bodiless Self or make<br>

Nay, let me work within my mortal bounds,<br>
Not live beyond life nor think beyond the mind;<br>
Our smallness saves us from the Infinite.<br>
In a frozen grandeur lone and desolate<br>
Call me not to die the great eternal death,<br>
Left naked of my own humanity<br>
In the chill vast of the spirit’s boundlessness.<br>
Each creature by its nature’s limits lives,<br>
And how can one evade his native fate?<br>
Human I am, human let me remain<br>
Till in the Inconscient I fall dumb and sleep.<br>
A high insanity, a chimaera is this,<br>
To think that God lives hidden in the clay<br>
And that eternal Truth can dwell in Time,<br>
And call to her to save our self and world.<br>
How can man grow immortal and divine<br>
Transmuting the very stuff of which he is made?<br>
This wizard gods may dream, not thinking men.”<br>
And Savitri heard the voice, the warped answer heard<br>
And turning to her being of light she spoke:<br>

To raise the spirit to its forgotten heights<br>
And wake the soul by touches of the heavens.<br>
Because thou art, the soul draws near to God;<br>
Because thou art, love grows in spite of hate<br>
And knowledge walks unslain in the pit of Night.<br>
But not by showering heaven’s golden rain<br>
Upon the intellect’s hard and rocky soil<br>
Can the tree of Paradise flower on earthly ground<br>
And the Bird of Paradise sit upon life’s boughs<br>
And the winds of Paradise visit mortal air.<br>
Even if thou rain down intuition’s rays,<br>

And fill his yearning heart with heaven’s fire<br>
And bring God down into his body and life.<br>
One day I will return, His hand in mine,<br>
And thou shalt see the face of the Absolute.<br>
Then shall the holy marriage be achieved,<br>
Then shall the divine family be born.<br>
There shall be light and peace in all the worlds.”<br>

<br>
The Finding of the Soul<br>
ONWARD she passed seeking the soul’s mystic cave.<br>
At first she stepped into a night of God.<br>
The light was quenched that helps the labouring world,<br>
The power that struggles and stumbles in our life;<br>
This inefficient mind gave up its thoughts,<br>
The striving heart its unavailing hopes.<br>
All knowledge failed and the Idea’s forms<br>
And Wisdom screened in awe her lowly head<br>
Feeling a Truth too great for thought or speech,<br>
Formless, ineffable, for ever the same.<br>
An innocent and holy Ignorance<br>
Adored like one who worships formless God<br>
The unseen Light she could not claim nor own.<br>
In a simple purity of emptiness<br>
Her mind knelt down before the unknowable.<br>
All was abolished save her naked self<br>
And the prostrate yearning of her surrendered heart:<br>
There was no strength in her, no pride of force;<br>
The lofty burning of desire had sunk<br>
Ashamed, a vanity of separate self,<br>
The hope of spiritual greatness fled,<br>
Salvation she asked not nor a heavenly crown:<br>
Humility seemed now too proud a state.<br>
Her self was nothing, God alone was all,<br>
Yet God she knew not but only knew he was.<br>
A sacred darkness brooded now within,<br>
The world was a deep darkness great and nude.<br>
This void held more than all the teeming worlds,<br>
This blank felt more than all that Time has borne,<br>
This dark knew dumbly, immensely the Unknown.<br>
But all was formless, voiceless, infinite.<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Finding of the Soul<br>
<br>
As might a shadow walk in a shadowy scene,<br>
A small nought passing through a mightier Nought,<br>
A night of person in a bare outline<br>
Crossing a fathomless impersonal Night,<br>
Silent she moved, empty and absolute.<br>
In endless Time her soul reached a wide end,<br>
The spaceless Vast became her spirit’s place.<br>
At last a change approached, the emptiness broke;<br>
A wave rippled within, the world had stirred;<br>
Once more her inner self became her space.<br>
There was felt a blissful nearness to the goal;<br>
Heaven leaned low to kiss the sacred hill,<br>
The air trembled with passion and delight.<br>
A rose of splendour on a tree of dreams,<br>
The face of Dawn out of mooned twilight grew.<br>
Day came, priest of a sacrifice of joy<br>
Into the worshipping silence of her world;<br>
He carried immortal lustre as his robe,<br>
Trailed heaven like a purple scarf and wore<br>
As his vermilion caste-mark a red sun.<br>
As if an old remembered dream come true,<br>
She recognised in her prophetic mind<br>
The imperishable lustre of that sky,<br>
The tremulous sweetness of that happy air<br>
And, covered from mind’s view and life’s approach,<br>
The mystic cavern in the sacred hill<br>
And knew the dwelling of her secret soul.<br>
As if in some Elysian occult depth,<br>
Truth’s last retreat from thought’s profaning touch,<br>
As if in a rock-temple’s solitude hid,<br>
God’s refuge from an ignorant worshipping world,<br>
It lay withdrawn even from life’s inner sense,<br>
Receding from the entangled heart’s desire.<br>
A marvellous brooding twilight met the eyes<br>
And a holy stillness held that voiceless space.<br>
An awful dimness wrapped the great rock-doors<br>
<br>
523<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Carved in the massive stone of Matter’s trance.<br>
Two golden serpents round the lintel curled,<br>
Enveloping it with their pure and dreadful strength,<br>
Looked out with wisdom’s deep and luminous eyes.<br>
An eagle covered it with wide conquering wings:<br>
Flames of self-lost immobile reverie,<br>
Doves crowded the grey musing cornices<br>
Like sculptured postures of white-bosomed peace.<br>
Across the threshold’s sleep she entered in<br>
And found herself amid great figures of gods<br>
Conscious in stone and living without breath,<br>
Watching with fixed regard the soul of man,<br>
Executive figures of the cosmic self,<br>
World-symbols of immutable potency.<br>
On the walls covered with significant shapes<br>
Looked at her the life-scene of man and beast<br>
And the high meaning of the life of gods,<br>
The power and necessity of these numberless worlds,<br>
And faces of beings and stretches of world-space<br>
Spoke the succinct and inexhaustible<br>
Hieratic message of the climbing planes.<br>
In their immensitude signing infinity<br>
They were the extension of the self of God<br>
And housed, impassively receiving all,<br>
His figures and his small and mighty acts<br>
And his passion and his birth and life and death<br>
And his return to immortality.<br>
To the abiding and eternal is their climb,<br>
To the pure existence everywhere the same,<br>
To the sheer consciousness and the absolute force<br>
And the unimaginable and formless bliss,<br>
To the mirth in Time and the timeless mystery<br>
Of the triune being who is all and one<br>
And yet is no one but himself apart.<br>
There was no step of breathing men, no sound,<br>
Only the living nearness of the soul.<br>
<br>
524<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Finding of the Soul<br>
<br>
525<br>
<br>
Yet all the worlds and God himself were there,<br>
For every symbol was a reality<br>
And brought the presence which had given it life.<br>
All this she saw and inly felt and knew<br>
Not by some thought of mind but by the self.<br>
A light not born of sun or moon or fire,<br>
A light that dwelt within and saw within<br>
Shedding an intimate visibility<br>
Made secrecy more revealing than the word:<br>
Our sight and sense are a fallible gaze and touch<br>
And only the spirit’s vision is wholly true.<br>
As thus she passed in that mysterious place<br>
Through room and room, through door and rock-hewn door,<br>
She felt herself made one with all she saw.<br>
A sealed identity within her woke;<br>
She knew herself the Beloved of the Supreme:<br>
These Gods and Goddesses were he and she:<br>
The Mother was she of Beauty and Delight,<br>
The Word in Brahma’s vast creating clasp,<br>
The World-Puissance on almighty Shiva’s lap, —<br>
The Master and the Mother of all lives<br>
Watching the worlds their twin regard had made,<br>
And Krishna and Radha for ever entwined in bliss,<br>
The Adorer and Adored self-lost and one.<br>
In the last chamber on a golden seat<br>
One sat whose shape no vision could define;<br>
Only one felt the world’s unattainable fount,<br>
A Power of which she was a straying Force,<br>
An invisible Beauty, goal of the world’s desire,<br>
A Sun of which all knowledge is a beam,<br>
A Greatness without whom no life could be.<br>
Thence all departed into silent self,<br>
And all became formless and pure and bare.<br>
Then through a tunnel dug in the last rock<br>
She came out where there shone a deathless sun.<br>
A house was there all made of flame and light<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
And crossing a wall of doorless living fire<br>
There suddenly she met her secret soul.<br>
A being stood immortal in transience,<br>
Deathless dallying with momentary things,<br>
In whose wide eyes of tranquil happiness<br>
Which pity and sorrow could not abrogate<br>
Infinity turned its gaze on finite shapes:<br>
Observer of the silent steps of the hours,<br>
Eternity upheld the minute’s acts<br>
And the passing scenes of the Everlasting’s play.<br>
In the mystery of its selecting will,<br>
In the Divine Comedy a participant,<br>
The Spirit’s conscious representative,<br>
God’s delegate in our humanity,<br>
Comrade of the universe, the Transcendent’s ray,<br>
She had come into the mortal body’s room<br>
To play at ball with Time and Circumstance.<br>
A joy in the world her master movement here,<br>
The passion of the game lighted her eyes:<br>
A smile on her lips welcomed earth’s bliss and grief,<br>
A laugh was her return to pleasure and pain.<br>
All things she saw as a masquerade of Truth<br>
Disguised in the costumes of Ignorance,<br>
Crossing the years to immortality;<br>
All she could front with the strong spirit’s peace.<br>
But since she knows the toil of mind and life<br>
As a mother feels and shares her children’s lives,<br>
She puts forth a small portion of herself,<br>
A being no bigger than the thumb of man<br>
Into a hidden region of the heart<br>
To face the pang and to forget the bliss,<br>
To share the suffering and endure earth’s wounds<br>
And labour mid the labour of the stars.<br>
This in us laughs and weeps, suffers the stroke,<br>
Exults in victory, struggles for the crown;<br>
<br>
526<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Finding of the Soul<br>
<br>
Identified with the mind and body and life,<br>
It takes on itself their anguish and defeat,<br>
Bleeds with Fate’s whips and hangs upon the cross,<br>
Yet is the unwounded and immortal self<br>
Supporting the actor in the human scene.<br>
Through this she sends us her glory and her powers,<br>
Pushes to wisdom’s heights, through misery’s gulfs;<br>
She gives us strength to do our daily task<br>
And sympathy that partakes of others’ grief<br>
And the little strength we have to help our race,<br>
We who must fill the role of the universe<br>
Acting itself out in a slight human shape<br>
And on our shoulders carry the struggling world.<br>
This is in us the godhead small and marred;<br>
In this human portion of divinity<br>
She seats the greatness of the Soul in Time<br>
To uplift from light to light, from power to power,<br>
Till on a heavenly peak it stands, a king.<br>
In body weak, in its heart an invincible might,<br>
It climbs stumbling, held up by an unseen hand,<br>
A toiling spirit in a mortal shape.<br>
Here in this chamber of flame and light they met;<br>
They looked upon each other, knew themselves,<br>
The secret deity and its human part,<br>
The calm immortal and the struggling soul.<br>
Then with a magic transformation’s speed<br>
They rushed into each other and grew one.<br>
Once more she was human upon earthly soil<br>
In the muttering night amid the rain-swept woods<br>
And the rude cottage where she sat in trance:<br>
That subtle world withdrew deeply within<br>
Behind the sun-veil of the inner sight.<br>
But now the half-opened lotus bud of her heart<br>
Had bloomed and stood disclosed to the earthly ray;<br>
In an image shone revealed her secret soul.<br>
<br>
527<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
There was no wall severing the soul and mind,<br>
No mystic fence guarding from the claims of life.<br>
In its deep lotus home her being sat<br>
As if on concentration’s marble seat,<br>
Calling the mighty Mother of the worlds<br>
To make this earthly tenement her house.<br>
As in a flash from a supernal light,<br>
A living image of the original Power,<br>
A face, a form came down into her heart<br>
And made of it its temple and pure abode.<br>
But when its feet had touched the quivering bloom,<br>
A mighty movement rocked the inner space<br>
As if a world were shaken and found its soul:<br>
Out of the Inconscient’s soulless mindless night<br>
A flaming Serpent rose released from sleep.<br>
It rose billowing its coils and stood erect<br>
And climbing mightily, stormily on its way<br>
It touched her centres with its flaming mouth;<br>
As if a fiery kiss had broken their sleep,<br>
They bloomed and laughed surcharged with light and bliss.<br>
Then at the crown it joined the Eternal’s space.<br>
In the flower of the head, in the flower of Matter’s base,<br>
In each divine stronghold and Nature-knot<br>
It held together the mystic stream which joins<br>
The viewless summits with the unseen depths,<br>
The string of forts that make the frail defence<br>
Safeguarding us against the enormous world,<br>
Our lines of self-expression in its Vast.<br>
An image sat of the original Power<br>
Wearing the mighty Mother’s form and face.<br>
Armed, bearer of the weapon and the sign<br>
Whose occult might no magic can imitate,<br>
Manifold yet one she sat, a guardian force:<br>
A saviour gesture stretched her lifted arm,<br>
And symbol of some native cosmic strength,<br>
A sacred beast lay prone below her feet,<br>
<br>
528<br>
<br>
CANTO V: The Finding of the Soul<br>
<br>
A silent flame-eyed mass of living force.<br>
All underwent a high celestial change:<br>
Breaking the black Inconscient’s blind mute wall,<br>
Effacing the circles of the Ignorance,<br>
Powers and divinities burst flaming forth;<br>
Each part of the being trembling with delight<br>
Lay overwhelmed with tides of happiness<br>
And saw her hand in every circumstance<br>
And felt her touch in every limb and cell.<br>
In the country of the lotus of the head<br>
Which thinking mind has made its busy space,<br>
In the castle of the lotus twixt the brows<br>
Whence it shoots the arrows of its sight and will,<br>
In the passage of the lotus of the throat<br>
Where speech must rise and the expressing mind<br>
And the heart’s impulse run towards word and act,<br>
A glad uplift and a new working came.<br>
The immortal’s thoughts displaced our bounded view,<br>
The immortal’s thoughts earth’s drab idea and sense;<br>
All things now bore a deeper heavenlier sense.<br>
A glad clear harmony marked their truth’s outline,<br>
Reset the balance and measures of the world.<br>
Each shape showed its occult design, unveiled<br>
God’s meaning in it for which it was made<br>
And the vivid splendour of his artist thought.<br>
A channel of the mighty Mother’s choice,<br>
The immortal’s will took into its calm control<br>
Our blind or erring government of life;<br>
A loose republic once of wants and needs,<br>
Then bowed to the uncertain sovereign mind,<br>
Life now obeyed to a diviner rule<br>
And every act became an act of God.<br>
In the kingdom of the lotus of the heart<br>
Love chanting its pure hymeneal hymn<br>
Made life and body mirrors of sacred joy<br>
And all the emotions gave themselves to God.<br>
<br>
529<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
In the navel lotus’ broad imperial range<br>
Its proud ambitions and its master lusts<br>
Were tamed into instruments of a great calm sway<br>
To do a work of God on earthly soil.<br>
In the narrow nether centre’s petty parts<br>
Its childish game of daily dwarf desires<br>
Was changed into a sweet and boisterous play,<br>
A romp of little gods with life in Time.<br>
In the deep place where once the Serpent slept,<br>
There came a grip on Matter’s giant powers<br>
For large utilities in life’s little space;<br>
A firm ground was made for Heaven’s descending might.<br>
Behind all reigned her sovereign deathless soul:<br>
Casting aside its veil of Ignorance,<br>
Allied to gods and cosmic beings and powers<br>
It built the harmony of its human state;<br>
Surrendered into the great World-Mother’s hands<br>
Only she obeyed her sole supreme behest<br>
In the enigma of the Inconscient’s world.<br>
A secret soul behind supporting all<br>
Is master and witness of our ignorant life,<br>
Admits the Person’s look and Nature’s role.<br>
But once the hidden doors are flung apart<br>
Then the veiled king steps out in Nature’s front;<br>
A Light comes down into the Ignorance,<br>
Its heavy painful knot loosens its grasp:<br>
The mind becomes a mastered instrument<br>
And life a hue and figure of the soul.<br>
All happily grows towards knowledge and towards bliss.<br>
A divine Puissance then takes Nature’s place<br>
And pushes the movements of our body and mind;<br>
Possessor of our passionate hopes and dreams,<br>
The beloved despot of our thoughts and acts,<br>
She streams into us with her unbound force,<br>
Into mortal limbs the Immortal’s rapture and power.<br>
An inner law of beauty shapes our lives;<br>

CANTO V: The Finding of the Soul<br>
<br>
531<br>
<br>
Our words become the natural speech of Truth,<br>
Each thought is a ripple on a sea of Light.<br>
Then sin and virtue leave the cosmic lists;<br>
They struggle no more in our delivered hearts:<br>
Our acts chime with God’s simple natural good<br>
Or serve the rule of a supernal Right.<br>
All moods unlovely, evil and untrue<br>
Forsake their stations in fierce disarray<br>
And hide their shame in the subconscient’s dusk.<br>
Then lifts the mind a cry of victory:<br>
“O soul, my soul, we have created Heaven,<br>
Within we have found the kingdom here of God,<br>
His fortress built in a loud ignorant world.<br>
Our life is entrenched between two rivers of Light,<br>
We have turned space into a gulf of peace<br>
And made the body a Capitol of bliss.<br>
What more, what more, if more must still be done?”<br>
In the slow process of the evolving spirit,<br>
In the brief stade between a death and birth<br>
A first perfection’s stage is reached at last;<br>
Out of the wood and stone of our nature’s stuff<br>
A temple is shaped where the high gods could live.<br>
Even if the struggling world is left outside<br>
One man’s perfection still can save the world.<br>
There is won a new proximity to the skies,<br>
A first betrothal of the Earth to Heaven,<br>
A deep concordat between Truth and Life:<br>
A camp of God is pitched in human time.<br>

<br>
Nirvana and the Discovery of the<br>
All-Negating Absolute<br>
A CALM slow sun looked down from tranquil heavens.<br>
A routed sullen rearguard of retreat,<br>
The last rains had fled murmuring across the woods<br>
Or failed, a sibilant whisper mid the leaves,<br>
And the great blue enchantment of the sky<br>
Recovered the deep rapture of its smile.<br>
Its mellow splendour unstressed by storm-licked heats<br>
Found room for a luxury of warm mild days,<br>
The night’s gold treasure of autumnal moons<br>
Came floating shipped through ripples of faery air.<br>
And Savitri’s life was glad, fulfilled like earth’s;<br>
She had found herself, she knew her being’s aim.<br>
Although her kingdom of marvellous change within<br>
Remained unspoken in her secret breast,<br>
All that lived round her felt its magic’s charm:<br>
The trees’ rustling voices told it to the winds,<br>
Flowers spoke in ardent hues an unknown joy,<br>
The birds’ carolling became a canticle,<br>
The beasts forgot their strife and lived at ease.<br>
Absorbed in wide communion with the Unseen<br>
The mild ascetics of the wood received<br>
A sudden greatening of their lonely muse.<br>
This bright perfection of her inner state<br>
Poured overflowing into her outward scene,<br>
Made beautiful dull common natural things<br>
And action wonderful and time divine.<br>
Even the smallest meanest work became<br>
A sweet or glad and glorious sacrament,<br>
An offering to the self of the great world<br>
Or a service to the One in each and all.<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
A light invaded all from her being’s light;<br>
Her heart-beats’ dance communicated bliss:<br>
Happiness grew happier, shared with her, by her touch<br>
And grief some solace found when she drew near.<br>
Above the cherished head of Satyavan<br>
She saw not now Fate’s dark and lethal orb;<br>
A golden circle round a mystic sun<br>
Disclosed to her new-born predicting sight<br>
The cyclic rondure of a sovereign life.<br>
In her visions and deep-etched veridical dreams,<br>
In brief shiftings of the future’s heavy screen,<br>
He lay not by a dolorous decree<br>
A victim in the dismal antre of death<br>
Or borne to blissful regions far from her<br>
Forgetting the sweetness of earth’s warm delight,<br>
Forgetting the passionate oneness of love’s clasp,<br>
Absolved in the self-rapt immortal’s bliss.<br>
Always he was with her, a living soul<br>
That met her eyes with close enamoured eyes,<br>
A living body near to her body’s joy.<br>
But now no longer in these great wild woods<br>
In kinship with the days of bird and beast<br>
And levelled to the bareness of earth’s brown breast,<br>
But mid the thinking high-built lives of men<br>
In tapestried chambers and on crystal floors,<br>
In armoured town or gardened pleasure-walks,<br>
Even in distance closer than her thoughts,<br>
Body to body near, soul near to soul,<br>
Moving as if by a common breath and will<br>
They were tied in the single circling of their days<br>
Together by love’s unseen atmosphere,<br>
Inseparable like the earth and sky.<br>
Thus for a while she trod the Golden Path;<br>
This was the sun before abysmal Night.<br>
Once as she sat in deep felicitous muse,<br>
Still quivering from her lover’s strong embrace,<br>
<br>
533<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
And made her joy a bridge twixt earth and heaven,<br>
An abyss yawned suddenly beneath her heart.<br>
A vast and nameless fear dragged at her nerves<br>
As drags a wild beast its half-slaughtered prey;<br>
It seemed to have no den from which it sprang:<br>
It was not hers, but hid its unseen cause.<br>
Then rushing came its vast and fearful Fount.<br>
A formless Dread with shapeless endless wings<br>
Filling the universe with its dangerous breath,<br>
A denser darkness than the Night could bear,<br>
Enveloped the heavens and possessed the earth.<br>
A rolling surge of silent death, it came<br>
Curving round the far edge of the quaking globe;<br>
Effacing heaven with its enormous stride<br>
It willed to expunge the choked and anguished air<br>
And end the fable of the joy of life.<br>
It seemed her very being to forbid,<br>
Abolishing all by which her nature lived,<br>
And laboured to blot out her body and soul,<br>
A clutch of some half-seen Invisible,<br>
An ocean of terror and of sovereign might,<br>
A person and a black infinity.<br>
It seemed to cry to her without thought or word<br>
The message of its dark eternity<br>
And the awful meaning of its silences:<br>
Out of some sullen monstrous vast arisen,<br>
Out of an abysmal deep of grief and fear<br>
Imagined by some blind regardless self,<br>
A consciousness of being without its joy,<br>
Empty of thought, incapable of bliss,<br>
That felt life blank and nowhere found a soul,<br>
A voice to the dumb anguish of the heart<br>
Conveyed a stark sense of unspoken words;<br>
In her own depths she heard the unuttered thought<br>
That made unreal the world and all life meant.<br>
“Who art thou who claimst thy crown of separate birth,<br>
<br>
534<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
The illusion of thy soul’s reality<br>
And personal godhead on an ignorant globe<br>
In the animal body of imperfect man?<br>
Hope not to be happy in a world of pain<br>
And dream not, listening to the unspoken Word<br>
And dazzled by the inexpressible Ray,<br>
Transcending the mute Superconscient’s realm,<br>
To give a body to the Unknowable,<br>
Or for a sanction to thy heart’s delight<br>
To burden with bliss the silent still Supreme<br>
Profaning its bare and formless sanctity,<br>
Or call into thy chamber the Divine<br>
And sit with God tasting a human joy.<br>
I have created all, all I devour;<br>
I am Death and the dark terrible Mother of life,<br>
I am Kali black and naked in the world,<br>
I am Maya and the universe is my cheat.<br>
I lay waste human happiness with my breath<br>
And slay the will to live, the joy to be<br>
That all may pass back into nothingness<br>
And only abide the eternal and absolute.<br>
For only the blank Eternal can be true.<br>
All else is shadow and flash in Mind’s bright glass,<br>
Mind, hollow mirror in which Ignorance sees<br>
A splendid figure of its own false self<br>
And dreams it sees a glorious solid world.<br>
O soul, inventor of man’s thoughts and hopes,<br>
Thyself the invention of the moments’ stream,<br>
Illusion’s centre or subtle apex point,<br>
At last know thyself, from vain existence cease.”<br>
A shadow of the negating Absolute,<br>
The intolerant Darkness travelled surging past<br>
And ebbed in her the formidable Voice.<br>
It left behind her inner world laid waste:<br>
A barren silence weighed upon her heart,<br>
Her kingdom of delight was there no more;<br>
<br>
535<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Only her soul remained, its emptied stage,<br>
Awaiting the unknown eternal Will.<br>
Then from the heights a greater Voice came down,<br>
The Word that touches the heart and finds the soul,<br>
The voice of Light after the voice of Night:<br>
The cry of the Abyss drew Heaven’s reply,<br>
A might of storm chased by the might of the Sun.<br>
“O soul, bare not thy kingdom to the foe;<br>
Consent to hide thy royalty of bliss<br>
Lest Time and Fate find out its avenues<br>
And beat with thunderous knock upon thy gates.<br>
Hide whilst thou canst thy treasure of separate self<br>
Behind the luminous rampart of thy depths<br>
Till of a vaster empire it grows part.<br>
But not for self alone the Self is won:<br>
Content abide not with one conquered realm;<br>
Adventure all to make the whole world thine,<br>
To break into greater kingdoms turn thy force.<br>
Fear not to be nothing that thou mayst be all;<br>
Assent to the emptiness of the Supreme<br>
That all in thee may reach its absolute.<br>
Accept to be small and human on the earth,<br>
Interrupting thy new-born divinity,<br>
That man may find his utter self in God.<br>
If for thy own sake only thou hast come,<br>
An immortal spirit into the mortal’s world,<br>
To found thy luminous kingdom in God’s dark,<br>
In the Inconscient’s realm one shining star,<br>
One door in the Ignorance opened upon light,<br>
Why hadst thou any need to come at all?<br>
Thou hast come down into a struggling world<br>
To aid a blind and suffering mortal race,<br>
To open to Light the eyes that could not see,<br>
To bring down bliss into the heart of grief,<br>
To make thy life a bridge twixt earth and heaven;<br>
If thou wouldst save the toiling universe,<br>
<br>

<br>
The vast universal suffering feel as thine:<br>
Thou must bear the sorrow that thou claimst to heal;<br>
The day-bringer must walk in darkest night.<br>
He who would save the world must share its pain.<br>
If he knows not grief, how shall he find grief’s cure?<br>
If far he walks above mortality’s head,<br>
How shall the mortal reach that too high path?<br>
If one of theirs they see scale heaven’s peaks,<br>
Men then can hope to learn that titan climb.<br>
God must be born on earth and be as man<br>
That man being human may grow even as God.<br>
He who would save the world must be one with the world,<br>
All suffering things contain in his heart’s space<br>
And bear the grief and joy of all that lives.<br>
His soul must be wider than the universe<br>
And feel eternity as its very stuff,<br>
Rejecting the moment’s personality<br>
Know itself older than the birth of Time,<br>
Creation an incident in its consciousness,<br>
Arcturus and Belphegor grains of fire<br>
Circling in a corner of its boundless self,<br>
The world’s destruction a small transient storm<br>
In the calm infinity it has become.<br>
If thou wouldst a little loosen the vast chain,<br>
Draw back from the world that the Idea has made,<br>
Thy mind’s selection from the Infinite,<br>
Thy senses’ gloss on the Infinitesimal’s dance,<br>
Then shalt thou know how the great bondage came.<br>
Banish all thought from thee and be God’s void.<br>
Then shalt thou uncover the Unknowable<br>
And the Superconscient conscious grow on thy tops;<br>
Infinity’s vision through thy gaze shall pierce;<br>
Thou shalt look into the eyes of the Unknown,<br>
Find the hid Truth in things seen null and false,<br>
Behind things known discover Mystery’s rear.<br>
Thou shalt be one with God’s bare reality<br>
<br>

<br>
And the miraculous world he has become<br>
And the diviner miracle still to be<br>
When Nature who is now unconscious God<br>
Translucent grows to the Eternal’s light,<br>
Her seeing his sight, her walk his steps of power<br>
And life is filled with a spiritual joy<br>
And Matter is the Spirit’s willing bride.<br>
Consent to be nothing and none, dissolve Time’s work,<br>
Cast off thy mind, step back from form and name.<br>
Annul thyself that only God may be.”<br>
Thus spoke the mighty and uplifting Voice,<br>
And Savitri heard; she bowed her head and mused<br>
Plunging her deep regard into herself<br>
In her soul’s privacy in the silent Night.<br>
Aloof and standing back detached and calm,<br>
A witness of the drama of herself,<br>
A student of her own interior scene,<br>
She watched the passion and the toil of life<br>
And heard in the crowded thoroughfares of mind<br>
The unceasing tread and passage of her thoughts.<br>
All she allowed to rise that chose to stir;<br>
Calling, compelling nought, forbidding nought,<br>
She left all to the process formed in Time<br>
And the free initiative of Nature’s will.<br>
Thus following the complex human play<br>
She heard the prompter’s voice behind the scenes,<br>
Perceived the original libretto’s set<br>
And the organ theme of the composer Force.<br>
All she beheld that surges from man’s depths,<br>
The animal instincts prowling mid life’s trees,<br>
The impulses that whisper to the heart<br>
And passion’s thunder-chase sweeping the nerves;<br>
She saw the Powers that stare from the Abyss<br>
And the wordless Light that liberates the soul.<br>
But most her gaze pursued the birth of thought.<br>
<br>
538<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
Affranchised from the look of surface mind<br>
She paused not to survey the official case,<br>
The issue of forms from the office of the brain,<br>
Its factory of thought-sounds and soundless words<br>
And voices stored within unheard by men,<br>
Its mint and treasury of shining coin.<br>
These were but counters in mind’s symbol game,<br>
A gramophone’s discs, a reproduction’s film,<br>
A list of signs, a cipher and a code.<br>
In our unseen subtle body thought is born<br>
Or there it enters from the cosmic field.<br>
Oft from her soul stepped out a naked thought<br>
Luminous with mysteried lips and wonderful eyes;<br>
Or from her heart emerged some burning face<br>
And looked for life and love and passionate truth,<br>
Aspired to heaven or embraced the world<br>
Or led the fancy like a fleeting moon<br>
Across the dull sky of man’s common days,<br>
Amidst the doubtful certitudes of earth’s lore,<br>
To the celestial beauty of faith gave form,<br>
As if at flower-prints in a dingy room<br>
Laughed in a golden vase one living rose.<br>
A thaumaturgist sat in her heart’s deep,<br>
Compelled the forward stride, the upward look,<br>
Till wonder leaped into the illumined breast<br>
And life grew marvellous with transfiguring hope.<br>
A seeing will pondered between the brows;<br>
Thoughts, glistening Angels, stood behind the brain<br>
In flashing armour, folding hands of prayer,<br>
And poured heaven’s rays into the earthly form.<br>
Imaginations flamed up from her breast,<br>
Unearthly beauty, touches of surpassing joy<br>
And plans of miracle, dreams of delight:<br>
Around her navel lotus clustering close<br>
Her large sensations of the teeming worlds<br>
Streamed their dumb movements of the unformed Idea;<br>
<br>
539<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Invading the small sensitive flower of the throat<br>
They brought their mute unuttered resonances<br>
To kindle the figures of a heavenly speech.<br>
Below, desires formed their wordless wish,<br>
And longings of physical sweetness and ecstasy<br>
Translated into the accents of a cry<br>
Their grasp on objects and their clasp on souls.<br>
Her body’s thoughts climbed from her conscious limbs<br>
And carried their yearnings to its mystic crown<br>
Where Nature’s murmurs meet the Ineffable.<br>
But for the mortal prisoned in outward mind<br>
All must present their passports at its door;<br>
Disguised they must don the official cap and mask<br>
Or pass as manufactures of the brain,<br>
Unknown their secret truth and hidden source.<br>
Only to the inner mind they speak direct,<br>
Put on a body and assume a voice,<br>
Their passage seen, their message heard and known,<br>
Their birthplace and their natal mark revealed,<br>
And stand confessed to an immortal’s sight,<br>
Our nature’s messengers to the witness soul.<br>
Impenetrable, withheld from mortal sense,<br>
The inner chambers of the spirit’s house<br>
Disclosed to her their happenings and their guests;<br>
Eyes looked through crevices in the invisible wall<br>
And through the secrecy of unseen doors<br>
There came into mind’s little frontal room<br>
Thoughts that enlarged our limited human range,<br>
Lifted the ideal’s half-quenched or sinking torch<br>
Or peered through the finite at the infinite.<br>
A sight opened upon the invisible<br>
And sensed the shapes that mortal eyes see not,<br>
The sounds that mortal listening cannot hear,<br>
The blissful sweetness of the intangible’s touch;<br>
The objects that to us are empty air,<br>
Are there the stuff of daily experience<br>
<br>
540<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
And the common pabulum of sense and thought.<br>
The beings of the subtle realms appeared<br>
And scenes concealed behind our earthly scene;<br>
She saw the life of remote continents<br>
And distance deafened not to voices far;<br>
She felt the movements crossing unknown minds;<br>
The past’s events occurred before her eyes.<br>
The great world’s thoughts were part of her own thought,<br>
The feelings dumb for ever and unshared,<br>
The ideas that never found an utterance.<br>
The dim subconscient’s incoherent hints<br>
Laid bare a meaning twisted, deep and strange,<br>
The bizarre secret of their fumbling speech,<br>
Their links with underlying reality.<br>
The unseen grew visible and audible:<br>
Thoughts leaped down from a superconscient field<br>
Like eagles swooping from a viewless peak,<br>
Thoughts gleamed up from the screened subliminal depths<br>
Like golden fishes from a hidden sea.<br>
This world is a vast unbroken totality,<br>
A deep solidarity joins its contrary powers;<br>
God’s summits look back on the mute Abyss.<br>
So man evolving to divinest heights<br>
Colloques still with the animal and the Djinn;<br>
The human godhead with star-gazer eyes<br>
Lives still in one house with the primal beast.<br>
The high meets the low, all is a single plan.<br>
So she beheld the many births of thought,<br>
If births can be of what eternal is;<br>
For the Eternal’s powers are like himself,<br>
Timeless in the Timeless, in Time ever born.<br>
This too she saw that all in outer mind<br>
Is made, not born, a product perishable,<br>
Forged in the body’s factory by earth-force.<br>
This mind is a dynamic small machine<br>
Producing ceaselessly, till it wears out,<br>
<br>
541<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
With raw material drawn from the outside world,<br>
The patterns sketched out by an artist God.<br>
Often our thoughts are finished cosmic wares<br>
Admitted by a silent office gate<br>
And passed through the subconscient’s galleries,<br>
Then issued in Time’s mart as private make.<br>
For now they bear the living person’s stamp;<br>
A trick, a special hue claims them his own.<br>
All else is Nature’s craft and this too hers.<br>
Our tasks are given, we are but instruments;<br>
Nothing is all our own that we create:<br>
The Power that acts in us is not our force.<br>
The genius too receives from some high fount<br>
Concealed in a supernal secrecy<br>
The work that gives him an immortal name.<br>
The word, the form, the charm, the glory and grace<br>
Are missioned sparks from a stupendous Fire;<br>
A sample from the laboratory of God<br>
Of which he holds the patent upon earth,<br>
Comes to him wrapped in golden coverings;<br>
He listens for Inspiration’s postman knock<br>
And takes delivery of the priceless gift<br>
A little spoilt by the receiver mind<br>
Or mixed with the manufacture of his brain;<br>
When least defaced, then is it most divine.<br>
Although his ego claims the world for its use,<br>
Man is a dynamo for the cosmic work;<br>
Nature does most in him, God the high rest:<br>
Only his soul’s acceptance is his own.<br>
This independent, once a power supreme,<br>
Self-born before the universe was made,<br>
Accepting cosmos, binds himself Nature’s serf<br>
Till he becomes her freedman — or God’s slave.<br>
This is the appearance in our mortal front;<br>
Our greater truth of being lies behind:<br>
Our consciousness is cosmic and immense,<br>
<br>
542<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
But only when we break through Matter’s wall<br>
In that spiritual vastness can we stand<br>
Where we can live the masters of our world<br>
And mind is only a means and body a tool.<br>
For above the birth of body and of thought<br>
Our spirit’s truth lives in the naked self<br>
And from that height, unbound, surveys the world.<br>
Out of the mind she rose to escape its law<br>
That it might sleep in some deep shadow of self<br>
Or fall silent in the silence of the Unseen.<br>
High she attained and stood from Nature free<br>
And saw creation’s life from far above,<br>
Thence upon all she laid her sovereign will<br>
To dedicate it to God’s timeless calm:<br>
Then all grew tranquil in her being’s space,<br>
Only sometimes small thoughts arose and fell<br>
Like quiet waves upon a silent sea<br>
Or ripples passing over a lonely pool<br>
When a stray stone disturbs its dreaming rest.<br>
Yet the mind’s factory had ceased to work,<br>
There was no sound of the dynamo’s throb,<br>
There came no call from the still fields of life.<br>
Then even those stirrings rose in her no more;<br>
Her mind now seemed like a vast empty room<br>
Or like a peaceful landscape without sound.<br>
This men call quietude and prize as peace.<br>
But to her deeper sight all yet was there,<br>
Effervescing like a chaos under a lid;<br>
Feelings and thoughts cried out for word and act<br>
But found no response in the silenced brain:<br>
All was suppressed but nothing yet expunged;<br>
At every moment might explosion come.<br>
Then this too paused; the body seemed a stone.<br>
All now was a wide mighty vacancy,<br>
But still excluded from eternity’s hush;<br>
For still was far the repose of the Absolute<br>
<br>
543<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
And the ocean silence of Infinity.<br>
Even now some thoughts could cross her solitude;<br>
These surged not from the depths or from within<br>
Cast up from formlessness to seek a form,<br>
Spoke not the body’s need nor voiced life’s call.<br>
These seemed not born nor made in human Time:<br>
Children of cosmic Nature from a far world,<br>
Idea’s shapes in complete armour of words<br>
Posted like travellers in an alien space.<br>
Out of some far expanse they seemed to come<br>
As if carried on vast wings like large white sails,<br>
And with easy access reached the inner ear<br>
As though they used a natural privileged right<br>
To the high royal entries of the soul.<br>
As yet their path lay deep-concealed in light.<br>
Then looking to know whence the intruders came<br>
She saw a spiritual immensity<br>
Pervading and encompassing the world-space<br>
As ether our transparent tangible air,<br>
And through it sailing tranquilly a thought.<br>
As smoothly glides a ship nearing its port,<br>
Ignorant of embargo and blockade,<br>
Confident of entrance and the visa’s seal,<br>
It came to the silent city of the brain<br>
Towards its accustomed and expectant quay,<br>
But met a barring will, a blow of Force<br>
And sank vanishing in the immensity.<br>
After a long vacant pause another appeared<br>
And others one by one suddenly emerged,<br>
Mind’s unexpected visitors from the Unseen<br>
Like far-off sails upon a lonely sea.<br>
But soon that commerce failed, none reached mind’s coast.<br>
Then all grew still, nothing moved any more:<br>
Immobile, self-rapt, timeless, solitary<br>
A silent spirit pervaded silent Space.<br>
<br>
544<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
In that absolute stillness bare and formidable<br>
There was glimpsed an all-negating Void Supreme<br>
That claimed its mystic Nihil’s sovereign right<br>
To cancel Nature and deny the soul.<br>
Even the nude sense of self grew pale and thin:<br>
Impersonal, signless, featureless, void of forms<br>
A blank pure consciousness had replaced the mind.<br>
Her spirit seemed the substance of a name,<br>
The world a pictured symbol drawn on self,<br>
A dream of images, a dream of sounds<br>
Built up the semblance of a universe<br>
Or lent to spirit the appearance of a world.<br>
This was self-seeing; in that intolerant hush<br>
No notion and no concept could take shape,<br>
There was no sense to frame the figure of things,<br>
A sheer self-sight was there, no thought arose.<br>
Emotion slept deep down in the still heart<br>
Or lay buried in a cemetery of peace:<br>
All feelings seemed quiescent, calm or dead,<br>
As if the heart-strings rent could work no more<br>
And joy and grief could never rise again.<br>
The heart beat on with an unconscious rhythm<br>
But no response came from it and no cry.<br>
Vain was the provocation of events;<br>
Nothing within answered an outside touch,<br>
No nerve was stirred and no reaction rose.<br>
Yet still her body saw and moved and spoke;<br>
It understood without the aid of thought,<br>
It said whatever needed to be said,<br>
It did whatever needed to be done.<br>
There was no person there behind the act,<br>
No mind that chose or passed the fitting word:<br>
All wrought like an unerring apt machine.<br>
As if continuing old habitual turns,<br>
And pushed by an old unexhausted force<br>
The engine did the work for which it was made:<br>
<br>
545<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
Her consciousness looked on and took no part;<br>
All it upheld, in nothing had a share.<br>
There was no strong initiator will;<br>
An incoherence crossing a firm void<br>
Slipped into an order of related chance.<br>
A pure perception was the only power<br>
That stood behind her action and her sight.<br>
If that retired, all objects would be extinct,<br>
Her private universe would cease to be,<br>
The house she had built with bricks of thought and sense<br>
In the beginning after the birth of Space.<br>
This seeing was identical with the seen;<br>
It knew without knowledge all that could be known,<br>
It saw impartially the world go by,<br>
But in the same supine unmoving glance<br>
Saw too its abysmal unreality.<br>
It watched the figure of the cosmic game,<br>
But the thought and inner life in forms seemed dead,<br>
Abolished by her own collapse of thought:<br>
A hollow physical shell persisted still.<br>
All seemed a brilliant shadow of itself,<br>
A cosmic film of scenes and images:<br>
The enduring mass and outline of the hills<br>
Was a design sketched on a silent mind<br>
And held to a tremulous false solidity<br>
By constant beats of visionary sight.<br>
The forest with its emerald multitudes<br>
Clothed with its show of hues vague empty Space,<br>
A painting’s colours hiding a surface void<br>
That flickered upon dissolution’s edge;<br>
The blue heavens, an illusion of the eyes,<br>
Roofed in the mind’s illusion of a world.<br>
The men who walked beneath an unreal sky<br>
Seemed mobile puppets out of cardboard cut<br>
And pushed by unseen hands across the soil<br>
Or moving pictures upon Fancy’s film:<br>
<br>
546<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
There was no soul within, no power of life.<br>
The brain’s vibrations that appear like thought,<br>
The nerve’s brief answer to each contact’s knock,<br>
The heart’s quiverings felt as joy and grief and love<br>
Were twitchings of the body, their seeming self,<br>
That body forged from atoms and from gas<br>
A manufactured lie of Maya’s make,<br>
Its life a dream seen by the sleeping Void.<br>
The animals lone or trooping through the glades<br>
Fled like a passing vision of beauty and grace<br>
Imagined by some all-creating Eye.<br>
Yet something was there behind the fading scene;<br>
Wherever she turned, at whatsoever she looked,<br>
It was perceived, yet hid from mind and sight.<br>
The One only real shut itself from Space<br>
And stood aloof from the idea of Time.<br>
Its truth escaped from shape and line and hue.<br>
All else grew unsubstantial, self-annulled,<br>
This only everlasting seemed and true,<br>
Yet nowhere dwelt, it was outside the hours.<br>
This only could justify the labour of sight,<br>
But sight could not define for it a form;<br>
This only could appease the unsatisfied ear<br>
But hearing listened in vain for a missing sound;<br>
This answered not the sense, called not to Mind.<br>
It met her as the uncaught inaudible Voice<br>
That speaks for ever from the Unknowable.<br>
It met her like an omnipresent point<br>
Pure of dimensions, unfixed, invisible,<br>
The single oneness of its multiplied beat<br>
Accentuating its sole eternity.<br>
It faced her as some vast Nought’s immensity,<br>
An endless No to all that seems to be,<br>
An endless Yes to things ever unconceived<br>
And all that is unimagined and unthought,<br>
An eternal zero or untotalled Aught,<br>
<br>
547<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
A spaceless and a placeless Infinite.<br>
Yet eternity and infinity seemed but words<br>
Vainly affixed by mind’s incompetence<br>
To its stupendous lone reality.<br>
The world is but a spark-burst from its light,<br>
All moments flashes from its Timelessness,<br>
All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless<br>
That disappear from Mind when That is seen.<br>
It held, as if a shield before its face,<br>
A consciousness that saw without a seer,<br>
The Truth where knowledge is not nor knower nor known,<br>
The Love enamoured of its own delight<br>
In which the Lover is not nor the Beloved<br>
Bringing their personal passion into the Vast,<br>
The Force omnipotent in quietude,<br>
The Bliss that none can ever hope to taste.<br>
It cancelled the convincing cheat of self;<br>
A truth in nothingness was its mighty clue.<br>
If all existence could renounce to be<br>
And Being take refuge in Non-being’s arms<br>
And Non-being could strike out its ciphered round,<br>
Some lustre of that Reality might appear.<br>
A formless liberation came on her.<br>
Once sepulchred alive in brain and flesh<br>
She had risen up from body, mind and life;<br>
She was no more a Person in a world,<br>
She had escaped into infinity.<br>
What once had been herself had disappeared;<br>
There was no frame of things, no figure of soul.<br>
A refugee from the domain of sense,<br>
Evading the necessity of thought,<br>
Delivered from Knowledge and from Ignorance<br>
And rescued from the true and the untrue,<br>
She shared the Superconscient’s high retreat<br>
Beyond the self-born Word, the nude Idea,<br>
The first bare solid ground of consciousness;<br>
<br>
548<br>
<br>
CANTO VI: Nirvana and the All-Negating Absolute<br>
<br>
Beings were not there, existence had no place,<br>
There was no temptation of the joy to be.<br>
Unutterably effaced, no one and null,<br>
A vanishing vestige like a violet trace,<br>
A faint record merely of a self now past,<br>
She was a point in the unknowable.<br>
Only some last annulment now remained,<br>
Annihilation’s vague indefinable step:<br>
A memory of being still was there<br>
And kept her separate from nothingness:<br>
She was in That but still became not That.<br>
This shadow of herself so close to nought<br>
Could be again self’s point d’appui to live,<br>
Return out of the Inconceivable<br>
And be what some mysterious vast might choose.<br>
Even as the Unknowable decreed,<br>
She might be nought or new-become the All,<br>
Or if the omnipotent Nihil took a shape<br>
Emerge as someone and redeem the world.<br>
Even, she might learn what the mystic cipher held,<br>
This seeming exit or closed end of all<br>
Could be a blind tenebrous passage screened from sight,<br>
Her state the eclipsing shell of a darkened sun<br>
On its secret way to the Ineffable.<br>
Even now her splendid being might flame back<br>
Out of the silence and the nullity,<br>
A gleaming portion of the All-Wonderful,<br>
A power of some all-affirming Absolute,<br>
A shining mirror of the eternal Truth<br>
To show to the One-in-all its manifest face,<br>
To the souls of men their deep identity.<br>
Or she might wake into God’s quietude<br>
Beyond the cosmic day and cosmic night<br>
And rest appeased in his white eternity.<br>
But this was now unreal or remote<br>
Or covered in the mystic fathomless blank.<br>

<br>
In infinite Nothingness was the ultimate sign<br>
Or else the Real was the Unknowable.<br>
A lonely Absolute negated all:<br>
It effaced the ignorant world from its solitude<br>
And drowned the soul in its everlasting peace.<br>

<br>
The Discovery of the Cosmic Spirit<br>
and the Cosmic Consciousness<br>
IN THE little hermitage in the forest’s heart,<br>
In the sunlight and the moonlight and the dark<br>
The daily human life went plodding on<br>
Even as before with its small unchanging works<br>
And its spare outward body of routine<br>
And happy quiet of ascetic peace.<br>
The old beauty smiled of the terrestrial scene;<br>
She too was her old gracious self to men.<br>
The Ancient Mother clutched her child to her breast<br>
Pressing her close in her environing arms,<br>
As if earth ever the same could for ever keep<br>
The living spirit and body in her clasp,<br>
As if death were not there nor end nor change.<br>
Accustomed only to read outward signs<br>
None saw aught new in her, none divined her state;<br>
They saw a person where was only God’s vast,<br>
A still being or a mighty nothingness.<br>
To all she was the same perfect Savitri:<br>
A greatness and a sweetness and a light<br>
Poured out from her upon her little world.<br>
Life showed to all the same familiar face,<br>
Her acts followed the old unaltered round,<br>
She spoke the words that she was wont to speak<br>
And did the things that she had always done.<br>
Her eyes looked out on earth’s unchanging face,<br>
Around her soul’s muteness all moved as of old;<br>
A vacant consciousness watched from within,<br>
Empty of all but bare Reality.<br>
There was no will behind the word and act,<br>
No thought formed in her brain to guide the speech:<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
An impersonal emptiness walked and spoke in her,<br>
Something perhaps unfelt, unseen, unknown<br>
Guarded the body for its future work,<br>
Or Nature moved in her old stream of force.<br>
Perhaps she bore made conscious in her breast<br>
The miraculous Nihil, origin of our souls<br>
And source and sum of the vast world’s events,<br>
The womb and grave of thought, a cipher of God,<br>
A zero circle of being’s totality.<br>
It used her speech and acted in her acts,<br>
It was beauty in her limbs, life in her breath;<br>
The original Mystery wore her human face.<br>
Thus was she lost within to separate self;<br>
Her mortal ego perished in God’s night.<br>
Only a body was left, the ego’s shell<br>
Afloat mid drift and foam of the world-sea,<br>
A sea of dream watched by a motionless sense<br>
In a figure of unreal reality.<br>
An impersonal foresight could already see, —<br>
In the unthinking knowledge of the spirit<br>
Even now it seemed nigh done, inevitable, —<br>
The individual die, the cosmos pass;<br>
These gone, the transcendental grew a myth,<br>
The Holy Ghost without the Father and Son,<br>
Or, a substratum of what once had been,<br>
Being that never willed to bear a world<br>
Restored to its original loneliness,<br>
Impassive, sole, silent, intangible.<br>
Yet all was not extinct in this deep loss;<br>
The being travelled not towards nothingness.<br>
There was some high surpassing Secrecy,<br>
And when she sat alone with Satyavan,<br>
Her moveless mind with his that searched and strove,<br>
In the hush of the profound and intimate night<br>
She turned to the face of a veiled voiceless Truth<br>
Hid in the dumb recesses of the heart<br>
<br>

CANTO VII: The Cosmic Spirit and the Cosmic Consciousness<br>
<br>
Or waiting beyond the last peak climbed by Thought, —<br>
Unseen itself it sees the struggling world<br>
And prompts our quest, but cares not to be found, —<br>
Out of that distant Vast came a reply.<br>
Something unknown, unreached, inscrutable<br>
Sent down the messages of its bodiless Light,<br>
Cast lightning flashes of a thought not ours<br>
Crossing the immobile silence of her mind:<br>
In its might of irresponsible sovereignty<br>
It seized on speech to give those flamings shape,<br>
Made beat the heart of wisdom in a word<br>
And spoke immortal things through mortal lips.<br>
Or, listening to the sages of the woods,<br>
In question and in answer broke from her<br>
High strange revealings impossible to men,<br>
Something or someone secret and remote<br>
Took hold of her body for his mystic use,<br>
Her mouth was seized to channel ineffable truths,<br>
Knowledge unthinkable found an utterance.<br>
Astonished by a new enlightenment,<br>
Invaded by a streak of the Absolute,<br>
They marvelled at her, for she seemed to know<br>
What they had only glimpsed at times afar.<br>
These thoughts were formed not in her listening brain,<br>
Her vacant heart was like a stringless harp;<br>
Impassive the body claimed not its own voice,<br>
But let the luminous greatness through it pass.<br>
A dual Power at being’s occult poles<br>
Still acted, nameless and invisible:<br>
Her divine emptiness was their instrument.<br>
Inconscient Nature dealt with the world it had made,<br>
And using still the body’s instruments<br>
Slipped through the conscious void she had become;<br>
The superconscient Mystery through that Void<br>

As yet this great impersonal speech was rare.<br>

BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
But now the unmoving wide spiritual space<br>
In which her mind survived tranquil and bare,<br>
Admitted a traveller from the cosmic breadths:<br>
A thought came through draped as an outer voice.<br>
It called not for the witness of the mind,<br>
It spoke not to the hushed receiving heart;<br>
It came direct to the pure perception’s seat,<br>
An only centre now of consciousness,<br>
If centre could be where all seemed only space;<br>
No more shut in by body’s walls and gates<br>
Her being, a circle without circumference,<br>
Already now surpassed all cosmic bounds<br>
And more and more spread into infinity.<br>
This being was its own unbounded world,<br>
A world without form or feature or circumstance;<br>
It had no ground, no wall, no roof of thought,<br>
Yet saw itself and looked on all around<br>
In a silence motionless and illimitable.<br>
There was no person there, no centred mind,<br>
No seat of feeling on which beat events<br>
Or objects wrought and shaped reaction’s stress.<br>
There was no motion in this inner world,<br>
All was a still and even infinity.<br>
In her the Unseen, the Unknown waited his hour.<br>
But now she sat by sleeping Satyavan,<br>
Awake within, and the enormous Night<br>
Surrounded her with the Unknowable’s vast.<br>
A voice began to speak from her own heart<br>
That was not hers, yet mastered thought and sense.<br>
As it spoke all changed within her and without;<br>
All was, all lived; she felt all being one;<br>
The world of unreality ceased to be:<br>
There was no more a universe built by mind,<br>
Convicted as a structure or a sign;<br>
A spirit, a being saw created things<br>
<br>
554<br>
<br>
CANTO VII: The Cosmic Spirit and the Cosmic Consciousness<br>
<br>
And cast itself into unnumbered forms<br>
And was what it saw and made; all now became<br>
An evidence of one stupendous truth,<br>
A Truth in which negation had no place,<br>
A being and a living consciousness,<br>
A stark and absolute Reality.<br>
There the unreal could not find a place,<br>
The sense of unreality was slain:<br>
There all was conscious, made of the Infinite,<br>
All had a substance of Eternity.<br>
Yet this was the same Indecipherable;<br>
It seemed to cast from it universe like a dream<br>
Vanishing for ever into an original Void.<br>
But this was no more some vague ubiquitous point<br>
Or a cipher of vastness in unreal Nought.<br>
It was the same but now no more seemed far<br>
To the living clasp of her recovered soul.<br>
It was her self, it was the self of all,<br>
It was the reality of existing things,<br>
It was the consciousness of all that lived<br>
And felt and saw; it was Timelessness and Time,<br>
It was the Bliss of formlessness and form.<br>
It was all Love and the one Beloved’s arms,<br>
It was sight and thought in one all-seeing Mind,<br>
It was joy of Being on the peaks of God.<br>
She passed beyond Time into eternity,<br>
Slipped out of space and became the Infinite;<br>
Her being rose into unreachable heights<br>
And found no end of its journey in the Self.<br>
It plunged into the unfathomable deeps<br>
And found no end to the silent mystery<br>
That held all world within one lonely breast,<br>
Yet harboured all creation’s multitudes.<br>
She was all vastness and one measureless point,<br>
She was a height beyond heights, a depth beyond depths,<br>
She lived in the everlasting and was all<br>
<br>
555<br>
<br>
BOOK VII: The Book of Yoga<br>
<br>
That harbours death and bears the wheeling hours.<br>
All contraries were true in one huge spirit<br>
Surpassing measure, change and circumstance.<br>
An individual, one with cosmic self<br>
In the heart of the Transcendent’s miracle<br>
And the secret of World-personality<br>
Was the creator and the lord of all.<br>
Mind was a single innumerable look<br>
Upon himself and all that he became.<br>
Life was his drama and the Vast a stage,<br>
The universe was his body, God its soul.<br>
All was one single immense reality,<br>
All its innumerable phenomenon.<br>
Her spirit saw the world as living God;<br>
It saw the One and knew that all was He.<br>
She knew him as the Absolute’s self-space,<br>
One with her self and ground of all things here<br>
In which the world wanders seeking for the Truth<br>
Guarded behind its face of ignorance:<br>
She followed him through the march of endless Time.<br>
All Nature’s happenings were events in her,<br>
The heart-beats of the cosmos were her own,<br>
All beings thought and felt and moved in her;<br>
She inhabited the vastness of the world,<br>
Its distances were her nature’s boundaries,<br>
Its closenesses her own life’s intimacies.<br>
Her mind became familiar with its mind,<br>
Its body was her body’s larger frame<br>
In which she lived and knew herself in it<br>
One, multitudinous in its multitudes.<br>
She was a single being, yet all things;<br>
The world was her spirit’s wide circumference,<br>
The thoughts of others were her intimates,<br>
Their feelings close to her universal heart,<br>
Their bodies her many bodies kin to her;<br>
She was no more herself but all the world.<br>

<br>
Out of the infinitudes all came to her,<br>
Into the infinitudes sentient she spread,<br>
Infinity was her own natural home.<br>
Nowhere she dwelt, her spirit was everywhere,<br>
The distant constellations wheeled round her;<br>
Earth saw her born, all worlds were her colonies,<br>
The greater worlds of life and mind were hers;<br>
All Nature reproduced her in its lines,<br>
Its movements were large copies of her own.<br>
She was the single self of all these selves,<br>
She was in them and they were all in her.<br>
This first was an immense identity<br>
In which her own identity was lost:<br>
What seemed herself was an image of the Whole.<br>
She was a subconscient life of tree and flower,<br>
The outbreak of the honied buds of spring;<br>
She burned in the passion and splendour of the rose,<br>
She was the red heart of the passion-flower,<br>
The dream-white of the lotus in its pool.<br>
Out of subconscient life she climbed to mind,<br>
She was thought and the passion of the world’s heart,<br>
She was the godhead hid in the heart of man,<br>
She was the climbing of his soul to God.<br>
The cosmos flowered in her, she was its bed.<br>
She was Time and the dreams of God in Time;<br>
She was Space and the wideness of his days.<br>
From this she rose where Time and Space were not;<br>
The superconscient was her native air,<br>
Infinity was her movement’s natural space;<br>
Eternity looked out from her on Time.<br>

Death in the Forest<br>
NOW it was here in this great golden dawn.<br>
By her still sleeping husband lain she gazed<br>
Into her past as one about to die<br>
Looks back upon the sunlit fields of life<br>
Where he too ran and sported with the rest,<br>
Lifting his head above the huge dark stream<br>
Into whose depths he must for ever plunge.<br>
All she had been and done she lived again.<br>
The whole year in a swift and eddying race<br>
Of memories swept through her and fled away<br>
Into the irrecoverable past.<br>
Then silently she rose and, service done,<br>
Bowed down to the great goddess simply carved<br>
By Satyavan upon a forest stone.<br>
What prayer she breathed her soul and Durga knew.<br>
Perhaps she felt in the dim forest huge<br>
The infinite Mother watching over her child,<br>
Perhaps the shrouded Voice spoke some still word.<br>
At last she came to the pale mother queen.<br>
She spoke but with guarded lips and tranquil face<br>
Lest some stray word or some betraying look<br>
Should let pass into the mother’s unknowing breast,<br>
Slaying all happiness and need to live,<br>
A dire foreknowledge of the grief to come.<br>
Only the needed utterance passage found:<br>
All else she pressed back into her anguished heart<br>
And forced upon her speech an outward peace.<br>

<br>
The Book of Death was taken from Canto Three of an early version of Savitri which had<br>
only six cantos and an epilogue. It was slightly revised at a late stage and a number of new<br>
lines were added, but it was never fully worked into the final version of the poem. Its original<br>
designation, “Canto Three”, has been retained as a reminder of this.<br>
<br>
BOOK VIII: The Book of Death<br>
<br>
“One year that I have lived with Satyavan<br>
Here on the emerald edge of the vast woods<br>
In the iron ring of the enormous peaks<br>
Under the blue rifts of the forest sky,<br>
I have not gone into the silences<br>
Of this great woodland that enringed my thoughts<br>
With mystery, nor in its green miracles<br>
Wandered, but this small clearing was my world.<br>
Now has a strong desire seized all my heart<br>
To go with Satyavan holding his hand<br>
Into the life that he has loved and touch<br>
Herbs he has trod and know the forest flowers<br>
And hear at ease the birds and the scurrying life<br>
That starts and ceases, rich far rustle of boughs<br>
And all the mystic whispering of the woods.<br>
Release me now and let my heart have rest.”<br>
She answered: “Do as thy wise mind desires,<br>
O calm child-sovereign with the eyes that rule.<br>
I hold thee for a strong goddess who has come<br>
Pitying our barren days; so dost thou serve<br>
Even as a slave might, yet art thou beyond<br>
All that thou doest, all our minds conceive,<br>
Like the strong sun that serves earth from above.”<br>
Then the doomed husband and the woman who knew<br>
Went with linked hands into that solemn world<br>
Where beauty and grandeur and unspoken dream,<br>
Where Nature’s mystic silence could be felt<br>
Communing with the secrecy of God.<br>
Beside her Satyavan walked full of joy<br>
Because she moved with him through his green haunts:<br>
He showed her all the forest’s riches, flowers<br>
Innumerable of every odour and hue<br>
And soft thick clinging creepers red and green<br>
And strange rich-plumaged birds, to every cry<br>
That haunted sweetly distant boughs replied<br>
With the shrill singer’s name more sweetly called.<br>
<br>
562<br>
<br>
Death in the Forest<br>
<br>
He spoke of all the things he loved: they were<br>
His boyhood’s comrades and his playfellows,<br>
Coevals and companions of his life<br>
Here in this world whose every mood he knew:<br>
Their thoughts which to the common mind are blank,<br>
He shared, to every wild emotion felt<br>
An answer. Deeply she listened, but to hear<br>
The voice that soon would cease from tender words<br>
And treasure its sweet cadences beloved<br>
For lonely memory when none by her walked<br>
And the beloved voice could speak no more.<br>
But little dwelt her mind upon their sense;<br>
Of death, not life she thought or life’s lone end.<br>
Love in her bosom hurt with the jagged edges<br>
Of anguish moaned at every step with pain<br>
Crying, “Now, now perhaps his voice will cease<br>
For ever.” Even by some vague touch oppressed<br>
Sometimes her eyes looked round as if their orbs<br>
Might see the dim and dreadful god’s approach.<br>
But Satyavan had paused. He meant to finish<br>
His labour here that happy, linked, uncaring<br>
They two might wander free in the green deep<br>
Primaeval mystery of the forest’s heart.<br>
A tree that raised its tranquil head to heaven<br>
Luxuriating in verdure, summoning<br>
The breeze with amorous wideness of its boughs,<br>
He chose and with his steel assailed the arm<br>
Brown, rough and strong hidden in its emerald dress.<br>
Wordless but near she watched, no turn to lose<br>
Of the bright face and body which she loved.<br>
Her life was now in seconds, not in hours,<br>
And every moment she economised<br>
Like a pale merchant leaned above his store,<br>
The miser of his poor remaining gold.<br>
But Satyavan wielded a joyous axe.<br>
He sang high snatches of a sage’s chant<br>
<br>
563<br>
<br>
BOOK VIII: The Book of Death<br>
<br>
That pealed of conquered death and demons slain,<br>
And sometimes paused to cry to her sweet speech<br>
Of love and mockery tenderer than love:<br>
She like a pantheress leaped upon his words<br>
And carried them into her cavern heart.<br>
But as he worked, his doom upon him came.<br>
The violent and hungry hounds of pain<br>
Travelled through his body biting as they passed<br>
Silently, and all his suffering breath besieged<br>
Strove to rend life’s strong heart-cords and be free.<br>
Then helped, as if a beast had left its prey,<br>
A moment in a wave of rich relief<br>
Reborn to strength and happy ease he stood<br>
Rejoicing and resumed his confident toil<br>
But with less seeing strokes. Now the great woodsman<br>
Hewed at him and his labour ceased: lifting<br>
His arm he flung away the poignant axe<br>
Far from him like an instrument of pain.<br>
She came to him in silent anguish and clasped,<br>
And he cried to her, “Savitri, a pang<br>
Cleaves through my head and breast as if the axe<br>
Were piercing it and not the living branch.<br>
Such agony rends me as the tree must feel<br>
When it is sundered and must lose its life.<br>
Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap<br>
And guard me with thy hands from evil fate:<br>
Perhaps because thou touchest, death may pass.”<br>
Then Savitri sat under branches wide,<br>
Cool, green against the sun, not the hurt tree<br>
Which his keen axe had cloven, — that she shunned;<br>
But leaned beneath a fortunate kingly trunk<br>
She guarded him in her bosom and strove to soothe<br>
His anguished brow and body with her hands.<br>
All grief and fear were dead within her now<br>
And a great calm had fallen. The wish to lessen<br>
His suffering, the impulse that opposes pain<br>
<br>
564<br>
<br>
Death in the Forest<br>
<br>
Were the one mortal feeling left. It passed:<br>
Griefless and strong she waited like the gods.<br>
But now his sweet familiar hue was changed<br>
Into a tarnished greyness and his eyes<br>
Dimmed over, forsaken of the clear light she loved.<br>
Only the dull and physical mind was left,<br>
Vacant of the bright spirit’s luminous gaze.<br>
But once before it faded wholly back,<br>
He cried out in a clinging last despair,<br>
“Savitri, Savitri, O Savitri,<br>
Lean down, my soul, and kiss me while I die.”<br>
And even as her pallid lips pressed his,<br>
His failed, losing last sweetness of response;<br>
His cheek pressed down her golden arm. She sought<br>
His mouth still with her living mouth, as if<br>
She could persuade his soul back with her kiss;<br>
Then grew aware they were no more alone.<br>
Something had come there conscious, vast and dire.<br>
Near her she felt a silent shade immense<br>
Chilling the noon with darkness for its back.<br>
An awful hush had fallen upon the place:<br>
There was no cry of birds, no voice of beasts.<br>
A terror and an anguish filled the world,<br>
As if annihilation’s mystery<br>
Had taken a sensible form. A cosmic mind<br>
Looked out on all from formidable eyes<br>
Contemning all with its unbearable gaze<br>
And with immortal lids and a vast brow<br>
It saw in its immense destroying thought<br>
All things and beings as a pitiful dream,<br>
Rejecting with calm disdain Nature’s delight,<br>
The wordless meaning of its deep regard<br>
Voicing the unreality of things<br>
And life that would be for ever but never was<br>
And its brief and vain recurrence without cease,<br>
As if from a Silence without form or name<br>

And its imitation of eternity.<br>

And Satyavan had passed from her embrace.<br>

SO WAS she left alone in the huge wood,<br>
Surrounded by a dim unthinking world,<br>
Her husband’s corpse on her forsaken breast.<br>
In her vast silent spirit motionless<br>
She measured not her loss with helpless thoughts,<br>
Nor rent with tears the marble seals of pain:<br>
She rose not yet to face the dreadful god.<br>
Over the body she loved her soul leaned out<br>
In a great stillness without stir or voice,<br>
As if her mind had died with Satyavan.<br>
But still the human heart in her beat on.<br>
Aware still of his being near to hers,<br>
Closely she clasped to her the mute lifeless form<br>
As though to guard the oneness they had been<br>
And keep the spirit still within its frame.<br>
Then suddenly there came on her the change<br>
Which in tremendous moments of our lives<br>
Can overtake sometimes the human soul<br>
And hold it up towards its luminous source.<br>
The veil is torn, the thinker is no more:<br>
Only the spirit sees and all is known.<br>
Then a calm Power seated above our brows<br>
Is seen, unshaken by our thoughts and deeds,<br>
Its stillness bears the voices of the world:<br>
Immobile, it moves Nature, looks on life.<br>
It shapes immutably its far-seen ends;<br>
Untouched and tranquil amid error and tears<br>
And measureless above our striving wills,<br>
Its gaze controls the turbulent whirl of things.<br>
To mate with the Glory it sees, the spirit grows:<br>
The voice of life is tuned to infinite sounds,<br>

BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
The moments on great wings of lightning come<br>
And godlike thoughts surprise the mind of earth.<br>
Into the soul’s splendour and intensity<br>
A crescent of miraculous birth is tossed,<br>
Whose horn of mystery floats in a bright void.<br>
As into a heaven of strength and silence thought<br>
Is ravished, all this living mortal clay<br>
Is seized and in a swift and fiery flood<br>
Of touches shaped by a Harmonist unseen.<br>
A new sight comes, new voices in us form<br>
A body of the music of the Gods.<br>
Immortal yearnings without name leap down,<br>
Large quiverings of godhead seeking run<br>
And weave upon a puissant field of calm<br>
A high and lonely ecstasy of will.<br>
This in a moment’s depths was born in her.<br>
Now to the limitless gaze disclosed that sees<br>
Things barred from human thinking’s earthly lids,<br>
The Spirit who had hidden in Nature soared<br>
Out of his luminous nest within the worlds:<br>
Like a vast fire it climbed the skies of night.<br>
Thus were the cords of self-oblivion torn:<br>
Like one who looks up to far heights she saw,<br>
Ancient and strong as on a windless summit<br>
Above her where she had worked in her lone mind<br>
Labouring apart in a sole tower of self,<br>
The source of all which she had seemed or wrought,<br>
A power projected into cosmic space,<br>
A slow embodiment of the aeonic will,<br>
A starry fragment of the eternal Truth,<br>
The passionate instrument of an unmoved Power.<br>
A Presence was there that filled the listening world;<br>
A central All assumed her boundless life.<br>
A sovereignty, a silence and a swiftness,<br>
One brooded over abysses who was she.<br>
As in a choric robe of unheard sounds<br>
<br>

CANTO I: Towards the Black Void<br>
<br>
A Force descended trailing endless lights;<br>
Linking Time’s seconds to infinity,<br>
Illimitably it girt the earth and her:<br>
It sank into her soul and she was changed.<br>
Then like a thought fulfilled by some great word<br>
That mightiness assumed a symbol form:<br>
Her being’s spaces quivered with its touch,<br>
It covered her as with immortal wings;<br>
On its lips the curve of the unuttered Truth,<br>
A halo of Wisdom’s lightnings for its crown,<br>
It entered the mystic lotus in her head,<br>
A thousand-petalled home of power and light.<br>
Immortal leader of her mortality,<br>
Doer of her works and fountain of her words,<br>
Invulnerable by Time, omnipotent,<br>
It stood above her calm, immobile, mute.<br>
All in her mated with that mighty hour,<br>
As if the last remnant had been slain by Death<br>
Of the humanity that once was hers.<br>
Assuming a spiritual wide control,<br>
Making life’s sea a mirror of heaven’s sky,<br>
The young divinity in her earthly limbs<br>
Filled with celestial strength her mortal part.<br>
Over was the haunted pain, the rending fear:<br>
Her grief had passed away, her mind was still,<br>
Her heart beat quietly with a sovereign force.<br>
There came a freedom from the heart-strings’ clutch,<br>
Now all her acts sprang from a godhead’s calm.<br>
Calmly she laid upon the forest soil<br>
The dead who still reposed upon her breast<br>
And bore to turn away from the dead form:<br>
Sole now she rose to meet the dreadful god.<br>
That mightier spirit turned its mastering gaze<br>
On life and things, inheritor of a work<br>
Left to it unfinished from her halting past,<br>
<br>

<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
When yet the mind, a passionate learner, toiled<br>
And ill-shaped instruments were crudely moved.<br>
Transcended now was the poor human rule;<br>
A sovereign power was there, a godlike will.<br>
A moment yet she lingered motionless<br>
And looked down on the dead man at her feet;<br>
Then like a tree recovering from a wind<br>
She raised her noble head; fronting her gaze<br>
Something stood there, unearthly, sombre, grand,<br>
A limitless denial of all being<br>
That wore the terror and wonder of a shape.<br>
In its appalling eyes the tenebrous Form<br>
Bore the deep pity of destroying gods;<br>
A sorrowful irony curved the dreadful lips<br>
That speak the word of doom. Eternal Night<br>
In the dire beauty of an immortal face<br>
Pitying arose, receiving all that lives<br>
For ever into its fathomless heart, refuge<br>
Of creatures from their anguish and world-pain.<br>
His shape was nothingness made real, his limbs<br>
Were monuments of transience and beneath<br>
Brows of unwearying calm large godlike lids<br>
Silent beheld the writhing serpent, life.<br>
Unmoved their timeless wide unchanging gaze<br>
Had seen the unprofitable cycles pass,<br>
Survived the passing of unnumbered stars<br>
And sheltered still the same immutable orbs.<br>
The two opposed each other with their eyes,<br>
Woman and universal god: around her,<br>
Piling their void unbearable loneliness<br>
Upon her mighty uncompanioned soul,<br>
Many inhuman solitudes came close.<br>
Vacant eternities forbidding hope<br>
Laid upon her their huge and lifeless look,<br>
And to her ears, silencing earthly sounds,<br>
A sad and formidable voice arose<br>
<br>
574<br>
<br>
CANTO I: Towards the Black Void<br>
<br>
575<br>
<br>
Which seemed the whole adverse world’s. “Unclasp”, it cried,<br>
“Thy passionate influence and relax, O slave<br>
Of Nature, changing tool of changeless Law,<br>
Who vainly writh’st rebellion to my yoke,<br>
Thy elemental grasp; weep and forget.<br>
Entomb thy passion in its living grave.<br>
Leave now the once-loved spirit’s abandoned robe:<br>
Pass lonely back to thy vain life on earth.”<br>
It ceased, she moved not, and it spoke again,<br>
Lowering its mighty key to human chords, —<br>
Yet a dread cry behind the uttered sounds,<br>
Echoing all sadness and immortal scorn,<br>
Moaned like a hunger of far wandering waves.<br>
“Wilt thou for ever keep thy passionate hold,<br>
Thyself a creature doomed like him to pass,<br>
Denying his soul death’s calm and silent rest?<br>
Relax thy grasp; this body is earth’s and thine,<br>
His spirit now belongs to a greater power.<br>
Woman, thy husband suffers.” Savitri<br>
Drew back her heart’s force that clasped his body still<br>
Where from her lap renounced on the smooth grass<br>
Softly it lay, as often before in sleep<br>
When from their couch she rose in the white dawn<br>
Called by her daily tasks: now too, as if called,<br>
She rose and stood gathered in lonely strength,<br>
Like one who drops his mantle for a race<br>
And waits the signal, motionlessly swift.<br>
She knew not to what course: her spirit above<br>
On the crypt-summit of her secret form<br>
Like one left sentinel on a mountain crest,<br>
A fiery-footed splendour puissant-winged,<br>
Watched flaming-silent, with her voiceless soul<br>
Like a still sail upon a windless sea.<br>
White passionless it rode, an anchored might,<br>
Waiting what far-ridged impulse should arise<br>
Out of the eternal depths and cast its surge.<br>
<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
Then Death the king leaned boundless down, as leans<br>
Night over tired lands, when evening pales<br>
And fading gleams break down the horizon’s walls,<br>
Nor yet the dusk grows mystic with the moon.<br>
The dim and awful godhead rose erect<br>
From his brief stooping to his touch on earth,<br>
And, like a dream that wakes out of a dream,<br>
Forsaking the poor mould of that dead clay,<br>
Another luminous Satyavan arose,<br>
Starting upright from the recumbent earth<br>
As if someone over viewless borders stepped<br>
Emerging on the edge of unseen worlds.<br>
In the earth’s day the silent marvel stood<br>
Between the mortal woman and the god.<br>
Such seemed he as if one departed came<br>
Wearing the light of a celestial shape<br>
Splendidly alien to the mortal air.<br>
The mind sought things long loved and fell back foiled<br>
From unfamiliar hues, beheld yet longed,<br>
By the sweet radiant form unsatisfied,<br>
Incredulous of its too bright hints of heaven;<br>
Too strange the brilliant phantasm to life’s clasp<br>
Desiring the warm creations of the earth<br>
Reared in the ardour of material suns,<br>
The senses seized in vain a glorious shade:<br>
Only the spirit knew the spirit still,<br>
And the heart divined the old loved heart, though changed.<br>
Between two realms he stood, not wavering,<br>
But fixed in quiet strong expectancy,<br>
Like one who, sightless, listens for a command.<br>
So were they immobile on that earthly field,<br>
Powers not of earth, though one in human clay.<br>
On either side of one two spirits strove;<br>
Silence battled with silence, vast with vast.<br>
But now the impulse of the Path was felt<br>
Moving from the Silence that supports the stars<br>
<br>

To touch the confines of the visible world.<br>
Luminous he moved away; behind him Death<br>
Went slowly with his noiseless tread, as seen<br>
In dream-built fields a shadowy herdsman glides<br>
Behind some wanderer from his voiceless herds,<br>
And Savitri moved behind eternal Death,<br>
Her mortal pace was equalled with the god’s.<br>
Wordless she travelled in her lover’s steps,<br>
Planting her human feet where his had trod,<br>
Into the perilous silences beyond.<br>
At first in a blind stress of woods she moved<br>
With strange inhuman paces on the soil,<br>
Journeying as if upon an unseen road.<br>
Around her on the green and imaged earth<br>
The flickering screen of forests ringed her steps;<br>
Its thick luxurious obstacle of boughs<br>
Besieged her body pressing dimly through<br>
In a rich realm of whispers palpable,<br>
And all the murmurous beauty of the leaves<br>
Rippled around her like an emerald robe.<br>
But more and more this grew an alien sound,<br>
And her old intimate body seemed to her<br>
A burden which her being remotely bore.<br>
Herself lived far in some uplifted scene<br>
Where to the trance-claimed vision of pursuit,<br>
Sole presences in a high spaceless dream,<br>
The luminous spirit glided stilly on<br>
And the great shadow travelled vague behind.<br>
Still with an amorous crowd of seeking hands<br>
Softly entreated by their old desires<br>
Her senses felt earth’s close and gentle air<br>
Cling round them and in troubled branches knew<br>
Uncertain treadings of a faint-foot wind:<br>
She bore dim fragrances, far callings touched;<br>
The wild bird’s voice and its winged rustle came<br>

BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
As if a sigh from some forgotten world.<br>
Earth stood aloof, yet near: round her it wove<br>
Its sweetness and its greenness and delight,<br>
Its brilliance suave of well-loved vivid hues,<br>
Sunlight arriving to its golden noon,<br>
And the blue heavens and the caressing soil.<br>
The ancient mother offered to her child<br>
Her simple world of kind familiar things.<br>
But now, as if the body’s sensuous hold<br>
Curbing the godhead of her infinite walk<br>
Had freed those spirits to their grander road<br>
Across some boundary’s intangible bar,<br>
The silent god grew mighty and remote<br>
In other spaces, and the soul she loved<br>
Lost its consenting nearness to her life.<br>
Into a deep and unfamiliar air<br>
Enormous, windless, without stir or sound<br>
They seemed to enlarge away, drawn by some wide<br>
Pale distance, from the warm control of earth<br>
And her grown far: now, now they would escape.<br>
Then flaming from her body’s nest alarmed<br>
Her violent spirit soared at Satyavan.<br>
Out mid the plunge of heaven-surrounded rocks<br>
So in a terror and a wrath divine<br>
From her eyrie streams against the ascending death,<br>
Indignant at its crouching point of steel,<br>
A fierce she-eagle threatened in her brood,<br>
Borne on a rush of puissance and a cry,<br>
Outwinging like a mass of golden fire.<br>
So on a spirit’s flaming outrush borne<br>
She crossed the borders of dividing sense;<br>
Like pale discarded sheaths dropped dully down<br>
Her mortal members fell back from her soul.<br>
A moment of a secret body’s sleep,<br>
Her trance knew not of sun or earth or world;<br>
Thought, time and death were absent from her grasp:<br>
<br>
578<br>
<br>
CANTO I: Towards the Black Void<br>
<br>
She knew not self, forgotten was Savitri.<br>
All was the violent ocean of a will<br>
Where lived captive to an immense caress,<br>
Possessed in a supreme identity,<br>
Her aim, joy, origin, Satyavan alone.<br>
Her sovereign prisoned in her being’s core,<br>
He beat there like a rhythmic heart, — herself<br>
But different still, one loved, enveloped, clasped,<br>
A treasure saved from the collapse of space.<br>
Around him nameless, infinite she surged,<br>
Her spirit fulfilled in his spirit, rich with all Time,<br>
As if Love’s deathless moment had been found,<br>
A pearl within eternity’s white shell.<br>
Then out of the engulfing sea of trance<br>
Her mind rose drenched to light streaming with hues<br>
Of vision and, awake once more to Time,<br>
Returned to shape the lineaments of things<br>
And live in borders of the seen and known.<br>
Onward the three still moved in her soul-scene.<br>
As if pacing through fragments of a dream,<br>
She seemed to travel on, a visioned shape<br>
Imagining other musers like herself,<br>
By them imagined in their lonely sleep.<br>
Ungrasped, unreal, yet familiar, old,<br>
Like clefts of unsubstantial memory,<br>
Scenes often traversed, never lived in, fled<br>
Past her unheeding to forgotten goals.<br>
In voiceless regions they were travellers<br>
Alone in a new world where souls were not,<br>
But only living moods: a strange hushed weird<br>
Country was round them, strange far skies above,<br>
A doubting space where dreaming objects lived<br>
Within themselves their one unchanged idea.<br>
Weird were the grasses, weird the treeless plains;<br>
Weird ran the road which like fear hastening<br>
Towards that of which it has most terror, passed<br>
<br>

BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
Phantasmal between pillared conscious rocks<br>
Sombre and high, gates brooding, whose stone thoughts<br>
Lost their huge sense beyond in giant night.<br>
Enigma of the Inconscient’s sculptural sleep,<br>
Symbols of the approach to darkness old<br>
And monuments of her titanic reign,<br>
Opening to depths like dumb appalling jaws<br>
That wait a traveller down a haunted path<br>
Attracted to a mystery that slays,<br>
They watched across her road, cruel and still;<br>
Sentinels they stood of dumb Necessity,<br>
Mute heads of vigilant and sullen gloom,<br>
Carved muzzle of a dim enormous world.<br>
Then, to that chill sere heavy line arrived<br>
Where his feet touched the shadowy marches’ brink,<br>
Turning arrested luminous Satyavan<br>
Looked back with his wonderful eyes at Savitri.<br>
But Death pealed forth his vast abysmal cry:<br>
“O mortal, turn back to thy transient kind;<br>
Aspire not to accompany Death to his home,<br>
As if thy breath could live where Time must die.<br>
Think not thy mind-born passion strength from heaven<br>
To uplift thy spirit from its earthly base<br>
And, breaking out from the material cage,<br>
To upbuoy thy feet of dream in groundless Nought<br>
And bear thee through the pathless infinite.<br>
Only in human limits man lives safe.<br>
Trust not in the unreal Lords of Time,<br>
Immortal deeming this image of thyself<br>
Which they have built on a Dream’s floating ground.<br>
Let not the dreadful goddess move thy soul<br>
To enlarge thy vehement trespass into worlds<br>
Where it shall perish like a helpless thought.<br>
Know the cold term-stones of thy hopes in life.<br>
Armed vainly with the Ideal’s borrowed might,<br>
Dare not to outstep man’s bound and measured force:<br>
<br>
580<br>
<br>
CANTO I: Towards the Black Void<br>
<br>
581<br>
<br>
Ignorant and stumbling, in brief boundaries pent,<br>
He crowns himself the world’s mock suzerain,<br>
Tormenting Nature with the works of Mind.<br>
O sleeper, dreaming of divinity,<br>
Wake trembling mid the indifferent silences<br>
In which thy few weak chords of being die.<br>
Impermanent creatures, sorrowful foam of Time,<br>
Your transient loves bind not the eternal gods.”<br>
The dread voice ebbed in the consenting hush<br>
Which seemed to close upon it, wide, intense,<br>
A wordless sanction from the jaws of Night.<br>
The Woman answered not. Her high nude soul,<br>
Stripped of the girdle of mortality,<br>
Against fixed destiny and the grooves of law<br>
Stood up in its sheer will a primal force.<br>
Still like a statue on its pedestal,<br>
Lone in the silence and to vastness bared,<br>
Against midnight’s dumb abysses piled in front<br>
A columned shaft of fire and light she rose.<br>
END OF CANTO ONE<br>
<br>
Canto Two<br>
<br>
The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
and the Voice of the Darkness<br>
AWHILE on the chill dreadful edge of Night<br>
All stood as if a world were doomed to die<br>
And waited on the eternal silence’ brink.<br>
Heaven leaned towards them like a cloudy brow<br>
Of menace through the dim and voiceless hush.<br>
As thoughts stand mute on a despairing verge<br>
Where the last depths plunge into nothingness<br>
And the last dreams must end, they paused; in their front<br>
Were glooms like shadowy wings, behind them, pale,<br>
The lifeless evening was a dead man’s gaze.<br>
Hungry beyond, the night desired her soul.<br>
But still in its lone niche of templed strength<br>
Motionless, her flame-bright spirit, mute, erect,<br>
Burned like a torch-fire from a windowed room<br>
Pointing against the darkness’ sombre breast.<br>
The Woman first affronted the Abyss<br>
Daring to journey through the eternal Night.<br>
Armoured with light she advanced her foot to plunge<br>
Into the dread and hueless vacancy;<br>
Immortal, unappalled, her spirit faced<br>
The danger of the ruthless eyeless waste.<br>
Against night’s inky ground they stirred, moulding<br>
Mysterious motion on her human tread,<br>
A swimming action and a drifting march<br>
Like figures moving before eyelids closed:<br>
All as in dreams went slipping, gliding on.<br>
The rock-gate’s heavy walls were left behind;<br>
As if through passages of receding time<br>
Present and past into the Timeless lapsed;<br>
Arrested upon dim adventure’s brink,<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
The future ended drowned in nothingness.<br>
Amid collapsing shapes they wound obscure;<br>
The fading vestibules of a tenebrous world<br>
Received them, where they seemed to move and yet<br>
Be still, nowhere advancing yet to pass,<br>
A dumb procession a dim picture bounds,<br>
Not conscious forms threading a real scene.<br>
A mystery of terror’s boundlessness,<br>
Gathering its hungry strength the huge pitiless void<br>
Surrounded slowly with its soundless depths,<br>
And monstrous, cavernous, a shapeless throat<br>
Devoured her into its shadowy strangling mass,<br>
The fierce spiritual agony of a dream.<br>
A curtain of impenetrable dread,<br>
The darkness hung around her cage of sense<br>
As, when the trees have turned to blotted shades<br>
And the last friendly glimmer fades away,<br>
Around a bullock in the forest tied<br>
By hunters closes in no empty night.<br>
The thought that strives in the world was here unmade;<br>
Its effort it renounced to live and know,<br>
Convinced at last that it had never been;<br>
It perished, all its dream of action done:<br>
This clotted cypher was its dark result.<br>
In the smothering stress of this stupendous Nought<br>
Mind could not think, breath could not breathe, the soul<br>
Could not remember or feel itself; it seemed<br>
A hollow gulf of sterile emptiness,<br>
A zero oblivious of the sum it closed,<br>
An abnegation of the Maker’s joy<br>
Saved by no wide repose, no depth of peace.<br>
On all that claims here to be Truth and God<br>
And conscious self and the revealing Word<br>
And the creative rapture of the Mind<br>
And Love and Knowledge and heart’s delight, there fell<br>
The immense refusal of the eternal No.<br>
<br>
583<br>
<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
As disappears a golden lamp in gloom<br>
Borne into distance from the eyes’ desire,<br>
Into the shadows vanished Savitri.<br>
There was no course, no path, no end or goal:<br>
Visionless she moved amid insensible gulfs,<br>
Or drove through some great black unknowing waste,<br>
Or whirled in a dumb eddy of meeting winds<br>
Assembled by the titan hands of Chance.<br>
There was none with her in the dreadful Vast:<br>
She saw no more the vague tremendous god,<br>
Her eyes had lost their luminous Satyavan.<br>
Yet not for this her spirit failed, but held<br>
More deeply than the bounded senses can<br>
Which grasp externally and find to lose,<br>
Its object loved. So when on earth they lived<br>
She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades<br>
A scene in her, its clefts her being’s vistas<br>
Opening their secrets to his search and joy,<br>
Because to jealous sweetness in her heart<br>
Whatever happy space his cherished feet<br>
Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing<br>
His body, passioning dumbly to his tread.<br>
But now a silent gulf between them came<br>
And to abysmal loneliness she fell,<br>
Even from herself cast out, from love remote.<br>
Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time<br>
Is measured by the throbs of the soul’s pain,<br>
In an unreal darkness empty and drear<br>
She travelled treading on the corpse of life,<br>
Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls.<br>
Solitary in the anguish of the void<br>
She lived in spite of death, she conquered still;<br>
In vain her puissant being was oppressed:<br>
Her heavy long monotony of pain<br>
Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired.<br>
At first a faint inextinguishable gleam,<br>
<br>
584<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
Pale but immortal, flickered in the gloom<br>
As if a memory came to spirits dead,<br>
A memory that wished to live again,<br>
Dissolved from mind in Nature’s natal sleep.<br>
It wandered like a lost ray of the moon<br>
Revealing to the night her soul of dread;<br>
Serpentine in the gleam the darkness lolled,<br>
Its black hoods jewelled with the mystic glow;<br>
Its dull sleek folds shrank back and coiled and slid,<br>
As though they felt all light a cruel pain<br>
And suffered from the pale approach of hope.<br>
Night felt assailed her heavy sombre reign;<br>
The splendour of some bright eternity<br>
Threatened with this faint beam of wandering Truth<br>
Her empire of the everlasting Nought.<br>
Implacable in her intolerant strength<br>
And confident that she alone was true,<br>
She strove to stifle the frail dangerous ray;<br>
Aware of an all-negating immensity<br>
She reared her giant head of Nothingness,<br>
Her mouth of darkness swallowing all that is;<br>
She saw in herself the tenebrous Absolute.<br>
But still the light prevailed and still it grew,<br>
And Savitri to her lost self awoke;<br>
Her limbs refused the cold embrace of death,<br>
Her heart-beats triumphed in the grasp of pain;<br>
Her soul persisted claiming for its joy<br>
The soul of the beloved now seen no more.<br>
Before her in the stillness of the world<br>
Once more she heard the treading of a god,<br>
And out of the dumb darkness Satyavan,<br>
Her husband, grew into a luminous shade.<br>
Then a sound pealed through that dead monstrous realm:<br>
Vast like the surge in a tired swimmer’s ears,<br>
Clamouring, a fatal iron-hearted roar,<br>
Death missioned to the night his lethal call.<br>
<br>
585<br>
<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
“This is my silent dark immensity,<br>
This is the home of everlasting Night,<br>
This is the secrecy of Nothingness<br>
Entombing the vanity of life’s desires.<br>
Hast thou beheld thy source, O transient heart,<br>
And known from what the dream thou art was made?<br>
In this stark sincerity of nude emptiness<br>
Hopest thou still always to last and love?”<br>
The Woman answered not. Her spirit refused<br>
The voice of Night that knew and Death that thought.<br>
In her beginningless infinity<br>
Through her soul’s reaches unconfined she gazed;<br>
She saw the undying fountains of her life,<br>
She knew herself eternal without birth.<br>
But still opposing her with endless night<br>
Death, the dire god, inflicted on her eyes<br>
The immortal calm of his tremendous gaze:<br>
“Although thou hast survived the unborn void<br>
Which never shall forgive, while Time endures,<br>
The primal violence that fashioned thought,<br>
Forcing the immobile vast to suffer and live,<br>
This sorrowful victory only hast thou won<br>
To live for a little without Satyavan.<br>
What shall the ancient goddess give to thee<br>
Who helps thy heart-beats? Only she prolongs<br>
The nothing dreamed existence and delays<br>
With the labour of living thy eternal sleep.<br>
A fragile miracle of thinking clay,<br>
Armed with illusions walks the child of Time.<br>
To fill the void around he feels and dreads,<br>
The void he came from and to which he goes,<br>
He magnifies his self and names it God.<br>
He calls the heavens to help his suffering hopes.<br>
He sees above him with a longing heart<br>
Bare spaces more unconscious than himself<br>
That have not even his privilege of mind,<br>
<br>
586<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
And empty of all but their unreal blue,<br>
And peoples them with bright and merciful powers.<br>
For the sea roars around him and earth quakes<br>
Beneath his steps, and fire is at his doors,<br>
And death prowls baying through the woods of life.<br>
Moved by the Presences with which he yearns,<br>
He offers in implacable shrines his soul<br>
And clothes all with the beauty of his dreams.<br>
The gods who watch the earth with sleepless eyes<br>
And guide its giant stumblings through the void,<br>
Have given to man the burden of his mind;<br>
In his unwilling heart they have lit their fires<br>
And sown in it incurable unrest.<br>
His mind is a hunter upon tracks unknown;<br>
Amusing Time with vain discovery,<br>
He deepens with thought the mystery of his fate<br>
And turns to song his laughter and his tears.<br>
His mortality vexing with the immortal’s dreams,<br>
Troubling his transience with the infinite’s breath,<br>
They gave him hungers which no food can fill;<br>
He is the cattle of the shepherd gods.<br>
His body the tether with which he is tied,<br>
They cast for fodder grief and hope and joy:<br>
His pasture ground they have fenced with Ignorance.<br>
Into his fragile undefended breast<br>
They have breathed a courage that is met by death,<br>
They have given a wisdom that is mocked by night,<br>
They have traced a journey that foresees no goal.<br>
Aimless man toils in an uncertain world,<br>
Lulled by inconstant pauses of his pain,<br>
Scourged like a beast by the infinite desire,<br>
Bound to the chariot of the dreadful gods.<br>
But if thou still canst hope and still wouldst love,<br>
Return to thy body’s shell, thy tie to earth,<br>
And with thy heart’s little remnants try to live.<br>
Hope not to win back to thee Satyavan.<br>
<br>
587<br>
<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
588<br>
<br>
Yet since thy strength deserves no trivial crown,<br>
Gifts I can give to soothe thy wounded life.<br>
The pacts which transient beings make with fate,<br>
And the wayside sweetness earth-bound hearts would pluck,<br>
These if thy will accepts make freely thine.<br>
Choose a life’s hopes for thy deceiving prize.”<br>
As ceased the ruthless and tremendous Voice,<br>
Unendingly there rose in Savitri,<br>
Like moonlit ridges on a shuddering flood,<br>
A stir of thoughts out of some silence born<br>
Across the sea of her dumb fathomless heart.<br>
At last she spoke; her voice was heard by Night:<br>
“I bow not to thee, O huge mask of death,<br>
Black lie of night to the cowed soul of man,<br>
Unreal, inescapable end of things,<br>
Thou grim jest played with the immortal spirit.<br>
Conscious of immortality I walk.<br>
A victor spirit conscious of my force,<br>
Not as a suppliant to thy gates I came:<br>
Unslain I have survived the clutch of Night.<br>
My first strong grief moves not my seated mind;<br>
My unwept tears have turned to pearls of strength:<br>
I have transformed my ill-shaped brittle clay<br>
Into the hardness of a statued soul.<br>
Now in the wrestling of the splendid gods<br>
My spirit shall be obstinate and strong<br>
Against the vast refusal of the world.<br>
I stoop not with the subject mob of minds<br>
Who run to glean with eager satisfied hands<br>
And pick from its mire mid many trampling feet<br>
Its scornful small concessions to the weak.<br>
Mine is the labour of the battling gods:<br>
Imposing on the slow reluctant years<br>
The flaming will that reigns beyond the stars,<br>
They lay the law of Mind on Matter’s works<br>
And win the soul’s wish from earth’s inconscient Force.<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
First I demand whatever Satyavan,<br>
My husband, waking in the forest’s charm<br>
Out of his long pure childhood’s lonely dreams,<br>
Desired and had not for his beautiful life.<br>
Give, if thou must, or, if thou canst, refuse.”<br>
Death bowed his head in scornful cold assent,<br>
The builder of this dreamlike earth for man<br>
Who has mocked with vanity all gifts he gave.<br>
Uplifting his disastrous voice he spoke:<br>
“Indulgent to the dreams my touch shall break,<br>
I yield to his blind father’s longing heart<br>
Kingdom and power and friends and greatness lost<br>
And royal trappings for his peaceful age,<br>
The pallid pomps of man’s declining days,<br>
The silvered decadent glories of life’s fall.<br>
To one who wiser grew by adverse Fate,<br>
Goods I restore the deluded soul prefers<br>
To impersonal nothingness’s bare sublime.<br>
The sensuous solace of the light I give<br>
To eyes which could have found a larger realm,<br>
A deeper vision in their fathomless night.<br>
For that this man desired and asked in vain<br>
While still he lived on earth and cherished hope.<br>
Back from the grandeur of my perilous realms<br>
Go, mortal, to thy small permitted sphere!<br>
Hasten swift-footed, lest to slay thy life<br>
The great laws thou hast violated, moved,<br>
Open at last on thee their marble eyes.”<br>
But Savitri answered the disdainful Shade:<br>
“World-spirit, I was thy equal spirit born.<br>
My will too is a law, my strength a god.<br>
I am immortal in my mortality.<br>
I tremble not before the immobile gaze<br>
Of the unchanging marble hierarchies<br>
That look with the stone eyes of Law and Fate.<br>
My soul can meet them with its living fire.<br>
<br>

<br>
BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
Out of thy shadow give me back again<br>
Into earth’s flowering spaces Satyavan<br>
In the sweet transiency of human limbs<br>
To do with him my spirit’s burning will.<br>
I will bear with him the ancient Mother’s load,<br>
I will follow with him earth’s path that leads to God.<br>
Else shall the eternal spaces open to me,<br>
While round us strange horizons far recede,<br>
Travelling together the immense unknown.<br>
For I who have trod with him the tracts of Time,<br>
Can meet behind his steps whatever night<br>
Or unimaginable stupendous dawn<br>
Breaks on our spirits in the untrod Beyond.<br>
Wherever thou leadst his soul I shall pursue.”<br>
But to her claim opposed, implacable,<br>
Insisting on the immutable Decree,<br>
Insisting on the immitigable Law<br>
And the insignificance of created things,<br>
Out of the rolling wastes of night there came<br>
Born from the enigma of the unknowable depths<br>
A voice of majesty and appalling scorn.<br>
As when the storm-haired Titan-striding sea<br>
Throws on a swimmer its tremendous laugh<br>
Remembering all the joy its waves have drowned,<br>
So from the darkness of the sovereign night<br>
Against the Woman’s boundless heart arose<br>
The almighty cry of universal Death.<br>
“Hast thou god-wings or feet that tread my stars,<br>
Frail creature with the courage that aspires,<br>
Forgetting thy bounds of thought, thy mortal role?<br>
Their orbs were coiled before thy soul was formed.<br>
I, Death, created them out of my void;<br>
All things I have built in them and I destroy.<br>
I made the worlds my net, each joy a mesh.<br>
A Hunger amorous of its suffering prey,<br>
Life that devours, my image see in things.<br>

CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
Mortal, whose spirit is my wandering breath,<br>
Whose transience was imagined by my smile,<br>
Flee clutching thy poor gains to thy trembling breast<br>
Pierced by my pangs Time shall not soon appease.<br>
Blind slave of my deaf force whom I compel<br>
To sin that I may punish, to desire<br>
That I may scourge thee with despair and grief<br>
And thou come bleeding to me at the last,<br>
Thy nothingness recognised, my greatness known,<br>
Turn nor attempt forbidden happy fields<br>
Meant for the souls that can obey my law,<br>
Lest in their sombre shrines thy tread awake<br>
From their uneasy iron-hearted sleep<br>
The Furies who avenge fulfilled desire.<br>
Dread lest in skies where passion hoped to live,<br>
The Unknown’s lightnings start and, terrified,<br>
Lone, sobbing, hunted by the hounds of heaven,<br>
A wounded and forsaken soul thou flee<br>
Through the long torture of the centuries,<br>
Nor many lives exhaust the tireless Wrath<br>
Hell cannot slake nor Heaven’s mercy assuage.<br>
I will take from thee the black eternal grip:<br>
Clasping in thy heart thy fate’s exiguous dole<br>
Depart in peace, if peace for man is just.”<br>
But Savitri answered meeting scorn with scorn,<br>
The mortal woman to the dreadful Lord:<br>
“Who is this God imagined by thy night,<br>
Contemptuously creating worlds disdained,<br>
Who made for vanity the brilliant stars?<br>
Not he who has reared his temple in my thoughts<br>
And made his sacred floor my human heart.<br>
My God is will and triumphs in his paths,<br>
My God is love and sweetly suffers all.<br>
To him I have offered hope for sacrifice<br>
And gave my longings as a sacrament.<br>
Who shall prohibit or hedge in his course,<br>

BOOK IX: The Book of Eternal Night<br>
<br>
The wonderful, the charioteer, the swift?<br>
A traveller of the million roads of life,<br>
His steps familiar with the lights of heaven<br>
Tread without pain the sword-paved courts of hell;<br>
There he descends to edge eternal joy.<br>
Love’s golden wings have power to fan thy void:<br>
The eyes of love gaze starlike through death’s night,<br>
The feet of love tread naked hardest worlds.<br>
He labours in the depths, exults on the heights;<br>
He shall remake thy universe, O Death.”<br>
She spoke and for a while no voice replied,<br>
While still they travelled through the trackless night<br>
And still that gleam was like a pallid eye<br>
Troubling the darkness with its doubtful gaze.<br>
Then once more came a deep and perilous pause<br>
In that unreal journey through blind Nought;<br>
Once more a Thought, a Word in the void arose<br>
And Death made answer to the human soul:<br>
“What is thy hope? to what dost thou aspire?<br>
This is thy body’s sweetest lure of bliss,<br>
Assailed by pain, a frail precarious form,<br>
To please for a few years thy faltering sense<br>
With honey of physical longings and the heart’s fire<br>
And, a vain oneness seeking, to embrace<br>
The brilliant idol of a fugitive hour.<br>
And thou, what art thou, soul, thou glorious dream<br>
Of brief emotions made and glittering thoughts,<br>
A thin dance of fireflies speeding through the night,<br>
A sparkling ferment in life’s sunlit mire?<br>
Wilt thou claim immortality, O heart,<br>
Crying against the eternal witnesses<br>
That thou and he are endless powers and last?<br>
Death only lasts and the inconscient Void.<br>
I only am eternal and endure.<br>
I am the shapeless formidable Vast,<br>
I am the emptiness that men call Space,<br>
<br>
592<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Journey in Eternal Night<br>
<br>
I am a timeless Nothingness carrying all,<br>
I am the Illimitable, the mute Alone.<br>
I, Death, am He; there is no other God.<br>
All from my depths are born, they live by death;<br>
All to my depths return and are no more.<br>
I have made a world by my inconscient Force.<br>
My Force is Nature that creates and slays<br>
The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live.<br>
I have made man her instrument and slave,<br>
His body I made my banquet, his life my food.<br>
Man has no other help but only Death;<br>
He comes to me at his end for rest and peace.<br>
I, Death, am the one refuge of thy soul.<br>
The Gods to whom man prays can help not man;<br>
They are my imaginations and my moods<br>
Reflected in him by illusion’s power.<br>
That which thou seest as thy immortal self<br>
Is a shadowy icon of my infinite,<br>
Is Death in thee dreaming of eternity.<br>
I am the Immobile in which all things move,<br>
I am the nude Inane in which they cease:<br>
I have no body and no tongue to speak,<br>
I commune not with human eye and ear;<br>
Only thy thought gave a figure to my void.<br>
Because, O aspirant to divinity,<br>
Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul,<br>
I have assumed a face, a form, a voice.<br>
But if there were a Being witnessing all,<br>
How should he help thy passionate desire?<br>
Aloof he watches sole and absolute,<br>
Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm.<br>
His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one.<br>
One endless watches the inconscient scene<br>
Where all things perish, as the foam the stars.<br>
The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan<br>
Changing was born and there no Savitri<br>

<br>
Claims from brief life her bribe of joy. There love<br>
Came never with his fretful eyes of tears,<br>
Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space.<br>
It wears no living face, it has no name,<br>
No gaze, no heart that throbs; it asks no second<br>
To aid its being or to share its joys.<br>
It is delight immortally alone.<br>
If thou desirest immortality,<br>
Be then alone sufficient to thy soul:<br>
Live in thyself; forget the man thou lov’st.<br>
My last grand death shall rescue thee from life;<br>
Then shalt thou rise into thy unmoved source.”<br>
But Savitri replied to the dread Voice:<br>
“O Death, who reasonest, I reason not,<br>
Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build<br>
Or builds in vain because she doubts her work.<br>
I am, I love, I see, I act, I will.”<br>
Death answered her, one deep surrounding cry:<br>
“Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love<br>
And cease to will, delivered from thy heart.<br>
So shalt thou rest for ever and be still,<br>
Consenting to the impermanence of things.”<br>
But Savitri replied for man to Death:<br>
“When I have loved for ever, I shall know.<br>
Love in me knows the truth all changings mask.<br>
I know that knowledge is a vast embrace:<br>
I know that every being is myself,<br>
In every heart is hidden the myriad One.<br>
I know the calm Transcendent bears the world,<br>
The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord:<br>
I feel his secret act, his intimate fire;<br>
I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice.<br>
I know my coming was a wave from God.<br>
For all his suns were conscient in my birth,<br>
And one who loves in us came veiled by death.<br>
Then was man born among the monstrous stars<br>

Dowered with a mind and heart to conquer thee.”<br>
In the eternity of his ruthless will<br>
Sure of his empire and his armoured might,<br>
Like one disdaining violent helpless words<br>
From victim lips Death answered not again.<br>
He stood in silence and in darkness wrapped,<br>
A figure motionless, a shadow vague,<br>
Girt with the terrors of his secret sword.<br>
Half-seen in clouds appeared a sombre face;<br>
Night’s dusk tiara was his matted hair,<br>
The ashes of the pyre his forehead’s sign.<br>
Once more a wanderer in the unending Night,<br>
Blindly forbidden by dead vacant eyes,<br>
She travelled through the dumb unhoping vasts.<br>
Around her rolled the shuddering waste of gloom,<br>
Its swallowing emptiness and joyless death<br>
Resentful of her thought and life and love.<br>
Through the long fading night by her compelled,<br>
Gliding half-seen on their unearthly path,<br>
Phantasmal in the dimness moved the three.<br>

The Dream Twilight of the Ideal<br>
ALL STILL was darkness dread and desolate;<br>
There was no change nor any hope of change.<br>
In this black dream which was a house of Void,<br>
A walk to Nowhere in a land of Nought,<br>
Ever they drifted without aim or goal;<br>
Gloom led to worse gloom, depth to an emptier depth,<br>
In some positive Non-being’s purposeless Vast<br>
Through formless wastes dumb and unknowable.<br>
An ineffectual beam of suffering light<br>
Through the despairing darkness dogged their steps<br>
Like the remembrance of a glory lost;<br>
Even while it grew, it seemed unreal there,<br>
Yet haunted Nihil’s chill stupendous realm,<br>
Unquenchable, perpetual, lonely, null,<br>
A pallid ghost of some dead eternity.<br>
It was as if she must pay now her debt,<br>
Her vain presumption to exist and think,<br>
To some brilliant Maya that conceived her soul.<br>
This most she must absolve with endless pangs,<br>
Her deep original sin, the will to be<br>
And the sin last, greatest, the spiritual pride,<br>
That, made of dust, equalled itself with heaven,<br>
Its scorn of the worm writhing in the mud,<br>
Condemned ephemeral, born from Nature’s dream,<br>
Refusal of the transient creature’s role,<br>
The claim to be a living fire of God,<br>
The will to be immortal and divine.<br>
In that tremendous darkness heavy and bare<br>
She atoned for all since the first act whence sprang<br>
The error of the consciousness of Time,<br>
The rending of the Inconscient’s seal of sleep,<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
The primal and unpardoned revolt that broke<br>
The peace and silence of the Nothingness<br>
Which was before a seeming universe<br>
Appeared in a vanity of imagined Space<br>
And life arose engendering grief and pain:<br>
A great Negation was the Real’s face<br>
Prohibiting the vain process of Time:<br>
And when there is no world, no creature more,<br>
When Time’s intrusion has been blotted out,<br>
It shall last, unbodied, saved from thought, at peace.<br>
Accursed in what had been her godhead source,<br>
Condemned to live for ever empty of bliss,<br>
Her immortality her chastisement,<br>
Her spirit, guilty of being, wandered doomed,<br>
Moving for ever through eternal Night.<br>
But Maya is a veil of the Absolute;<br>
A Truth occult has made this mighty world:<br>
The Eternal’s wisdom and self-knowledge act<br>
In ignorant Mind and in the body’s steps.<br>
The Inconscient is the Superconscient’s sleep.<br>
An unintelligible Intelligence<br>
Invents creation’s paradox profound;<br>
Spiritual thought is crammed in Matter’s forms,<br>
Unseen it throws out a dumb energy<br>
And works a miracle by a machine.<br>
All here is a mystery of contraries:<br>
Darkness a magic of self-hidden Light,<br>
Suffering some secret rapture’s tragic mask<br>
And death an instrument of perpetual life.<br>
Although Death walks beside us on Life’s road,<br>
A dim bystander at the body’s start<br>
And a last judgment on man’s futile works,<br>
Other is the riddle of its ambiguous face:<br>
Death is a stair, a door, a stumbling stride<br>
The soul must take to cross from birth to birth,<br>
A grey defeat pregnant with victory,<br>

A whip to lash us towards our deathless state.<br>
The inconscient world is the spirit’s self-made room,<br>
Eternal Night shadow of eternal Day.<br>
Night is not our beginning nor our end;<br>
She is the dark Mother in whose womb we have hid<br>
Safe from too swift a waking to world-pain.<br>
We came to her from a supernal Light,<br>
By Light we live and to the Light we go.<br>
Here in this seat of Darkness mute and lone,<br>
In the heart of everlasting Nothingness<br>
Light conquered now even by that feeble beam:<br>
Its faint infiltration drilled the blind deaf mass;<br>
Almost it changed into a glimmering sight<br>
That housed the phantom of an aureate Sun<br>
Whose orb pupilled the eye of Nothingness.<br>
A golden fire came in and burned Night’s heart;<br>
Her dusky mindlessness began to dream;<br>
The Inconscient conscious grew, Night felt and thought.<br>
Assailed in the sovereign emptiness of its reign<br>
The intolerant Darkness paled and drew apart<br>
Till only a few black remnants stained that Ray.<br>
But on a failing edge of dumb lost space<br>
Still a great dragon body sullenly loomed;<br>
Adversary of the slow struggling Dawn<br>
Defending its ground of tortured mystery,<br>
It trailed its coils through the dead martyred air<br>
And curving fled down a grey slope of Time.<br>
There is a morning twilight of the gods;<br>
Miraculous from sleep their forms arise<br>
And God’s long nights are justified by dawn.<br>
There breaks a passion and splendour of new birth<br>
And hue-winged visions stray across the lids,<br>
Heaven’s chanting heralds waken dim-eyed Space.<br>
The dreaming deities look beyond the seen<br>
And fashion in their thoughts the ideal worlds<br>

<br>
Sprung from a limitless moment of desire<br>
That once had lodged in some abysmal heart.<br>
Passed was the heaviness of the eyeless dark<br>
And all the sorrow of the night was dead:<br>
Surprised by a blind joy with groping hands<br>
Like one who wakes to find his dreams were true,<br>
Into a happy misty twilit world<br>
Where all ran after light and joy and love<br>
She slipped; there far-off raptures drew more close<br>
And deep anticipations of delight,<br>
For ever eager to be grasped and held,<br>
Were never grasped, yet breathed strange ecstasy.<br>
A pearl-winged indistinctness fleeting swam,<br>
An air that dared not suffer too much light.<br>
Vague fields were there, vague pastures gleamed, vague trees,<br>
Vague scenes dim-hearted in a drifting haze;<br>
Vague cattle white roamed glimmering through the mist;<br>
Vague spirits wandered with a bodiless cry,<br>
Vague melodies touched the soul and fled pursued<br>
Into harmonious distances unseized;<br>
Forms subtly elusive and half-luminous powers<br>
Wishing no goal for their unearthly course<br>
Strayed happily through vague ideal lands,<br>
Or floated without footing or their walk<br>
Left steps of reverie on sweet memory’s ground;<br>
Or they paced to the mighty measure of their thoughts<br>
Led by a low far chanting of the gods.<br>
A ripple of gleaming wings crossed the far sky;<br>
Birds like pale-bosomed imaginations flew<br>
With low disturbing voices of desire,<br>
And half-heard lowings drew the listening ear,<br>
As if the Sun-god’s brilliant kine were there<br>
Hidden in mist and passing towards the sun.<br>
These fugitive beings, these elusive shapes<br>
Were all that claimed the eye and met the soul,<br>
The natural inhabitants of that world.<br>
<br>
CANTO I: The Dream Twilight of the Ideal<br>
<br>
But nothing there was fixed or stayed for long;<br>
No mortal feet could rest upon that soil,<br>
No breath of life lingered embodied there.<br>
In that fine chaos joy fled dancing past<br>
And beauty evaded settled line and form<br>
And hid its sense in mysteries of hue;<br>
Yet gladness ever repeated the same notes<br>
And gave the sense of an enduring world;<br>
There was a strange consistency of shapes,<br>
And the same thoughts were constant passers-by<br>
And all renewed unendingly its charm<br>
Alluring ever the expectant heart<br>
Like music that one always waits to hear,<br>
Like the recurrence of a haunting rhyme.<br>
One touched incessantly things never seized,<br>
A skirt of worlds invisibly divine.<br>
As if a trail of disappearing stars<br>
There showered upon the floating atmosphere<br>
Colours and lights and evanescent gleams<br>
That called to follow into a magic heaven,<br>
And in each cry that fainted on the ear<br>
There was the voice of an unrealised bliss.<br>
An adoration reigned in the yearning heart,<br>
A spirit of purity, an elusive presence<br>
Of faery beauty and ungrasped delight<br>
Whose momentary and escaping thrill,<br>
However unsubstantial to our flesh,<br>
And brief even in imperishableness,<br>
Much sweeter seemed than any rapture known<br>
Earth or all-conquering heaven can ever give.<br>
Heaven ever young and earth too firm and old<br>
Delay the heart by immobility:<br>
Their raptures of creation last too long,<br>
Their bold formations are too absolute;<br>
Carved by an anguish of divine endeavour<br>
They stand up sculptured on the eternal hills,<br>

Or quarried from the living rocks of God<br>
Win immortality by perfect form.<br>
They are too intimate with eternal things:<br>
Vessels of infinite significances,<br>
They are too clear, too great, too meaningful;<br>
No mist or shadow soothes the vanquished sight,<br>
No soft penumbra of incertitude.<br>
These only touched a golden hem of bliss,<br>
The gleaming shoulder of some godlike hope,<br>
The flying feet of exquisite desires.<br>
On a slow trembling brink between night and day<br>
They shone like visitants from the morning star,<br>
Satisfied beginnings of perfection, first<br>
Tremulous imaginings of a heavenly world:<br>
They mingle in a passion of pursuit,<br>
Thrilled with a spray of joy too slight to tire.<br>
All in this world was shadowed forth, not limned,<br>
Like faces leaping on a fan of fire<br>
Or shapes of wonder in a tinted blur,<br>
Like fugitive landscapes painting silver mists.<br>
Here vision fled back from the sight alarmed,<br>
And sound sought refuge from the ear’s surprise,<br>
And all experience was a hasty joy.<br>
The joys here snatched were half-forbidden things,<br>
Timorous soul-bridals delicately veiled<br>
As when a goddess’ bosom dimly moves<br>
To first desire and her white soul transfigured,<br>
A glimmering Eden crossed by faery gleams,<br>
Trembles to expectation’s fiery wand,<br>
But nothing is familiar yet with bliss.<br>
All things in this fair realm were heavenly strange<br>
In a fleeting gladness of untired delight,<br>
In an insistency of magic change.<br>
Past vanishing hedges, hurrying hints of fields,<br>
Mid swift escaping lanes that fled her feet<br>
Journeying she wished no end: as one through clouds<br>

Travels upon a mountain ridge and hears<br>
Arising to him out of hidden depths<br>
Sound of invisible streams, she walked besieged<br>
By the illusion of a mystic space,<br>
A charm of bodiless touches felt and heard<br>
A sweetness as of voices high and dim<br>
Calling like travellers upon seeking winds<br>
Melodiously with an alluring cry.<br>
As if a music old yet ever new,<br>
Moving suggestions on her heart-strings dwelt,<br>
Thoughts that no habitation found, yet clung<br>
With passionate repetition to her mind,<br>
Desires that hurt not, happy only to live<br>
Always the same and always unfulfilled<br>
Sang in the breast like a celestial lyre.<br>
Thus all could last yet nothing ever be.<br>
In this beauty as of mind made visible,<br>
Dressed in its rays of wonder Satyavan<br>
Before her seemed the centre of its charm,<br>
Head of her loveliness of longing dreams<br>
And captain of the fancies of her soul.<br>
Even the dreadful majesty of Death’s face<br>
And its sombre sadness could not darken nor slay<br>
The intangible lustre of those fleeting skies.<br>
The sombre Shadow sullen, implacable<br>
Made beauty and laughter more imperative;<br>
Enhanced by his grey, joy grew more bright and dear;<br>
His dark contrast edging ideal sight<br>
Deepened unuttered meanings to the heart;<br>
Pain grew a trembling undertone of bliss<br>
And transience immortality’s floating hem,<br>
A moment’s robe in which she looked more fair,<br>
Its antithesis sharpening her divinity.<br>
A comrade of the Ray and Mist and Flame,<br>
By a moon-bright face a brilliant moment drawn,<br>
Almost she seemed a thought mid floating thoughts,<br>

Seen hardly by a visionary mind<br>
Amid the white inward musings of the soul.<br>
Half-vanquished by the dream-happiness around,<br>
Awhile she moved on an enchantment’s soil,<br>
But still remained possessor of her soul.<br>
Above, her spirit in its mighty trance<br>
Saw all, but lived for its transcendent task,<br>
Immutable like a fixed eternal star.<br>

THEN pealed the calm inexorable voice:<br>
Abolishing hope, cancelling life’s golden truths,<br>
Fatal its accents smote the trembling air.<br>
That lovely world swam thin and frail, most like<br>
Some pearly evanescent farewell gleam<br>
On the faint verge of dusk in moonless eves.<br>
“Prisoner of Nature, many-visioned spirit,<br>
Thought’s creature in the ideal’s realm enjoying<br>
Thy unsubstantial immortality<br>
The subtle marvellous mind of man has feigned,<br>
This is the world from which thy yearnings came.<br>
When it would build eternity from the dust,<br>
Man’s thought paints images illusion rounds;<br>
Prophesying glories it shall never see,<br>
It labours delicately among its dreams.<br>
Behold this fleeing of light-tasselled shapes,<br>
Aerial raiment of unbodied gods;<br>
A rapture of things that never can be born,<br>
Hope chants to hope a bright immortal choir;<br>
Cloud satisfies cloud, phantom to longing phantom<br>
Leans sweetly, sweetly is clasped or sweetly chased.<br>
This is the stuff from which the ideal is formed:<br>
Its builder is thought, its base the heart’s desire,<br>
But nothing real answers to their call.<br>
The ideal dwells not in heaven, nor on the earth,<br>
A bright delirium of man’s ardour of hope<br>
Drunk with the wine of its own fantasy.<br>
It is a brilliant shadow’s dreamy trail.<br>

Thy mortal longing made for thee a soul.<br>
This angel in thy body thou callst love,<br>
Who shapes his wings from thy emotion’s hues,<br>
In a ferment of thy body has been born<br>
And with the body that housed it it must die.<br>
It is a passion of thy yearning cells,<br>
It is flesh that calls to flesh to serve its lust;<br>
It is thy mind that seeks an answering mind<br>
And dreams awhile that it has found its mate;<br>
It is thy life that asks a human prop<br>
To uphold its weakness lonely in the world<br>
Or feeds its hunger on another’s life.<br>
A beast of prey that pauses in its prowl,<br>
It crouches under a bush in splendid flower<br>
To seize a heart and body for its food:<br>
This beast thou dreamst immortal and a god.<br>
O human mind, vainly thou torturest<br>
An hour’s delight to stretch through infinity’s<br>
Long void and fill its formless, passionless gulfs,<br>
Persuading the insensible Abyss<br>
To lend eternity to perishing things,<br>
And trickst the fragile movements of thy heart<br>
With thy spirit’s feint of immortality.<br>
All here emerges born from Nothingness;<br>
Encircled it lasts by the emptiness of Space,<br>
Awhile upheld by an unknowing Force,<br>
Then crumbles back into its parent Nought:<br>
Only the mute Alone can for ever be.<br>
In the Alone there is no room for love.<br>
In vain to clothe love’s perishable mud<br>
Thou hast woven on the Immortals’ borrowed loom<br>
The ideal’s gorgeous and unfading robe.<br>
The ideal never yet was real made.<br>

Unwillingly it descends to earthly air<br>
To inhabit a white temple in man’s heart:<br>
In his heart it shines rejected by his life.<br>
Immutable, bodiless, beautiful, grand and dumb,<br>
Immobile on its shining throne it sits;<br>
Dumb it receives his offering and his prayer.<br>
It has no voice to answer to his call,<br>
No feet that move, no hands to take his gifts:<br>

Virgin conception of a bodiless god,<br>
Its light stirs man the thinker to create<br>

Its hued reflection falls upon man’s acts;<br>
His institutions are its cenotaphs,<br>
He signs his dead conventions with its name;<br>
His virtues don the Ideal’s skiey robe<br>
And a nimbus of the outline of its face:<br>
He hides their littleness with the divine Name.<br>
Yet insufficient is the bright pretence<br>
To screen their indigent and earthy make:<br>
Earth only is there and not some heavenly source.<br>
If heavens there are they are veiled in their own light,<br>
If a Truth eternal somewhere reigns unknown,<br>
It burns in a tremendous void of God;<br>
For truth shines far from the falsehoods of the world;<br>
How can the heavens come down to unhappy earth<br>
Or the eternal lodge in drifting time?<br>
How shall the Ideal tread earth’s dolorous soil<br>
Where life is only a labour and a hope,<br>
A child of Matter and by Matter fed,<br>
A fire flaming low in Nature’s grate,<br>
A wave that breaks upon a shore in Time,<br>

Who with a magic ritual in earth’s house<br>
Worshippest ideal and eternal love,<br>
What is this love thy thought has deified,<br>
This sacred legend and immortal myth?<br>
It is a conscious yearning of thy flesh,<br>
It is a glorious burning of thy nerves,<br>
A rose of dream-splendour petalling thy mind,<br>
A great red rapture and torture of thy heart.<br>
A sudden transfiguration of thy days,<br>
It passes and the world is as before.<br>
A ravishing edge of sweetness and of pain,<br>
A thrill in its yearning makes it seem divine,<br>
A golden bridge across the roar of the years,<br>
A cord tying thee to eternity.<br>
And yet how brief and frail! how soon is spent<br>
This treasure wasted by the gods on man,<br>
This happy closeness as of soul to soul,<br>
This honey of the body’s companionship,<br>
This heightened joy, this ecstasy in the veins,<br>
This strange illumination of the sense!<br>
If Satyavan had lived, love would have died;<br>
But Satyavan is dead and love shall live<br>
A little while in thy sad breast, until<br>
His face and body fade on memory’s wall<br>
Where other bodies, other faces come.<br>

At first man steps into a world of the sun;<br>
In his passion he feels his heavenly element:<br>

But only a fine sunlit patch of earth<br>

The snake is there and the worm in the heart of the rose.<br>
A word, a moment’s act can slay the god;<br>
Precarious is his immortality,<br>
He has a thousand ways to suffer and die.<br>
Love cannot live by heavenly food alone,<br>
Only on sap of earth can it survive.<br>
For thy passion was a sensual want refined,<br>
A hunger of the body and the heart;<br>
Thy want can tire and cease or turn elsewhere.<br>
Or love may meet a dire and pitiless end<br>
By bitter treason, or wrath with cruel wounds<br>
Separate, or thy unsatisfied will to others<br>
Depart when first love’s joy lies stripped and slain:<br>
A dull indifference replaces fire<br>
Or an endearing habit imitates love:<br>
An outward and uneasy union lasts<br>
Or the routine of a life’s compromise:<br>
Where once the seed of oneness had been cast<br>
Into a semblance of spiritual ground<br>
By a divine adventure of heavenly powers<br>
Two strive, constant associates without joy,<br>
Two egos straining in a single leash,<br>
Two minds divided by their jarring thoughts,<br>
Two spirits disjoined, for ever separate.<br>
Thus is the ideal falsified in man’s world;<br>
Trivial or sombre, disillusion comes,<br>
Life’s harsh reality stares at the soul:<br>
Heaven’s hour adjourned flees into bodiless Time.<br>
Death saves thee from this and saves Satyavan:<br>
He now is safe, delivered from himself;<br>
He travels to silence and felicity.<br>
Call him not back to the treacheries of earth<br>
And the poor petty life of animal Man.<br>
In my vast tranquil spaces let him sleep<br>

<br>
In harmony with the mighty hush of death<br>
Where love lies slumbering on the breast of peace.<br>
And thou, go back alone to thy frail world:<br>
Chastise thy heart with knowledge, unhood to see,<br>
Thy nature raised into clear living heights,<br>
The heaven-bird’s view from unimagined peaks.<br>
For when thou givest thy spirit to a dream<br>
Soon hard necessity will smite thee awake:<br>
Purest delight began and it must end.<br>
Thou too shalt know, thy heart no anchor swinging,<br>
Thy cradled soul moored in eternal seas.<br>
Vain are the cycles of thy brilliant mind.<br>
Renounce, forgetting joy and hope and tears,<br>
Thy passionate nature in the bosom profound<br>
Of a happy Nothingness and worldless Calm,<br>
Delivered into my mysterious rest.<br>
One with my fathomless Nihil all forget.<br>
Forget thy fruitless spirit’s waste of force,<br>
Forget the weary circle of thy birth,<br>
Forget the joy and the struggle and the pain,<br>
The vague spiritual quest which first began<br>
When worlds broke forth like clusters of fire-flowers,<br>
And great burning thoughts voyaged through the sky of mind<br>
And Time and its aeons crawled across the vasts<br>
And souls emerged into mortality.”<br>

“A dangerous music now thou findst, O Death,<br>
Melting thy speech into harmonious pain,<br>
And flut’st alluringly to tired hopes<br>
Thy falsehoods mingled with sad strains of truth.<br>
But I forbid thy voice to slay my soul.<br>
My love is not a hunger of the heart,<br>
My love is not a craving of the flesh;<br>
It came to me from God, to God returns.<br>
Even in all that life and man have marred,<br>
A whisper of divinity still is heard,<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Gospel of Death and Vanity of the Ideal<br>
<br>
A breath is felt from the eternal spheres.<br>
Allowed by Heaven and wonderful to man<br>
A sweet fire-rhythm of passion chants to love.<br>
There is a hope in its wild infinite cry;<br>
It rings with callings from forgotten heights,<br>
And when its strains are hushed to high-winged souls<br>
In their empyrean, its burning breath<br>
Survives beyond, the rapturous core of suns<br>
That flame for ever pure in skies unseen,<br>
A voice of the eternal Ecstasy.<br>
One day I shall behold my great sweet world<br>
Put off the dire disguises of the gods,<br>
Unveil from terror and disrobe from sin.<br>
Appeased we shall draw near our mother’s face,<br>
We shall cast our candid souls upon her lap;<br>
Then shall we clasp the ecstasy we chase,<br>
Then shall we shudder with the long-sought god,<br>
Then shall we find Heaven’s unexpected strain.<br>
Not only is there hope for godheads pure;<br>
The violent and darkened deities<br>
Leaped down from the one breast in rage to find<br>
What the white gods had missed: they too are safe;<br>
A mother’s eyes are on them and her arms<br>
Stretched out in love desire her rebel sons.<br>
One who came love and lover and beloved<br>
Eternal, built himself a wondrous field<br>
And wove the measures of a marvellous dance.<br>
There in its circles and its magic turns<br>
Attracted he arrives, repelled he flees.<br>
In the wild devious promptings of his mind<br>
He tastes the honey of tears and puts off joy<br>
Repenting, and has laughter and has wrath,<br>
And both are a broken music of the soul<br>
Which seeks out reconciled its heavenly rhyme.<br>
Ever he comes to us across the years<br>
Bearing a new sweet face that is the old.<br>
<br>

<br>
His bliss laughs to us or it calls concealed<br>
Like a far-heard unseen entrancing flute<br>
From moonlit branches in the throbbing woods,<br>
Tempting our angry search and passionate pain.<br>
Disguised the Lover seeks and draws our souls.<br>
He named himself for me, grew Satyavan.<br>
For we were man and woman from the first,<br>
The twin souls born from one undying fire.<br>
Did he not dawn on me in other stars?<br>
How has he through the thickets of the world<br>
Pursued me like a lion in the night<br>
And come upon me suddenly in the ways<br>
And seized me with his glorious golden leap!<br>
Unsatisfied he yearned for me through time,<br>
Sometimes with wrath and sometimes with sweet peace<br>
Desiring me since first the world began.<br>
He rose like a wild wave out of the floods<br>
And dragged me helpless into seas of bliss.<br>
Out of my curtained past his arms arrive;<br>
They have touched me like the soft persuading wind,<br>
They have plucked me like a glad and trembling flower,<br>
And clasped me happily burned in ruthless flame.<br>
I too have found him charmed in lovely forms<br>
And run delighted to his distant voice<br>
And pressed to him past many dreadful bars.<br>
If there is a yet happier greater god,<br>
Let him first wear the face of Satyavan<br>
And let his soul be one with him I love;<br>
So let him seek me that I may desire.<br>
For only one heart beats within my breast<br>
And one god sits there throned. Advance, O Death,<br>
Beyond the phantom beauty of this world;<br>
For of its citizens I am not one.<br>
I cherish God the Fire, not God the Dream.”<br>
But Death once more inflicted on her heart<br>
The majesty of his calm and dreadful voice:<br>

<br>
“A bright hallucination are thy thoughts.<br>
A prisoner haled by a spiritual cord,<br>
Of thy own sensuous will the ardent slave,<br>
Thou sendest eagle-poised to meet the sun<br>
Words winged with the red splendour of thy heart.<br>
But knowledge dwells not in the passionate heart;<br>
The heart’s words fall back unheard from Wisdom’s throne.<br>
Vain is thy longing to build heaven on earth.<br>
Artificer of Ideal and Idea,<br>
Mind, child of Matter in the womb of Life,<br>
To higher levels persuades his parents’ steps:<br>
Inapt, they follow ill the daring guide.<br>
But Mind, a glorious traveller in the sky,<br>
Walks lamely on the earth with footsteps slow;<br>
Hardly he can mould the life’s rebellious stuff,<br>
Hardly can he hold the galloping hooves of sense:<br>
His thoughts look straight into the very heavens;<br>
They draw their gold from a celestial mine,<br>
His acts work painfully a common ore.<br>
All thy high dreams were made by Matter’s mind<br>
To solace its dull work in Matter’s jail,<br>
Its only house where it alone seems true.<br>
A solid image of reality<br>
Carved out of being to prop the works of Time,<br>
Matter on the firm earth sits strong and sure.<br>
It is the first-born of created things,<br>
It stands the last when mind and life are slain,<br>
And if it ended all would cease to be.<br>
All else is only its outcome or its phase:<br>
Thy soul is a brief flower by the gardener Mind<br>
Created in thy matter’s terrain plot;<br>
It perishes with the plant on which it grows,<br>
For from earth’s sap it draws its heavenly hue:<br>
Thy thoughts are gleams that pass on Matter’s verge,<br>
Thy life a lapsing wave on Matter’s sea.<br>
A careful steward of Truth’s limited means,<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
Treasuring her founded facts from the squandering Power,<br>
It tethers mind to the tent-posts of sense,<br>
To a leaden grey routine clamps Life’s caprice<br>
And ties all creatures with the cords of Law.<br>
A vessel of transmuting alchemies,<br>
A glue that sticks together mind and life,<br>
If Matter fails, all crumbling cracks and falls.<br>
All upon Matter stands as on a rock.<br>
Yet this security and guarantor<br>
Pressed for credentials an impostor proves:<br>
A cheat of substance where no substance is,<br>
An appearance and a symbol and a nought,<br>
Its forms have no original right to birth:<br>
Its aspect of a fixed stability<br>
Is the cover of a captive motion’s swirl,<br>
An order of the steps of Energy’s dance<br>
Whose footmarks leave for ever the same signs,<br>
A concrete face of unsubstantial Time,<br>
A trickle dotting the emptiness of Space:<br>
A stable-seeming movement without change,<br>
Yet change arrives and the last change is death.<br>
What seemed most real once, is Nihil’s show.<br>
Its figures are snares that trap and prison the sense;<br>
The beginningless Void was its artificer:<br>
Nothing is there but aspects limned by Chance<br>
And seeming shapes of seeming Energy.<br>
All by Death’s mercy breathe and live awhile,<br>
All think and act by the Inconscient’s grace.<br>
Addict of the roseate luxury of thy thoughts,<br>
Turn not thy gaze within thyself to look<br>
At visions in the gleaming crystal, Mind,<br>
Close not thy lids to dream the forms of Gods.<br>
At last to open thy eyes consent and see<br>
The stuff of which thou and the world are made.<br>
Inconscient in the dumb inconscient Void<br>
Inexplicably a moving world sprang forth:<br>
<br>
616<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Gospel of Death and Vanity of the Ideal<br>
<br>
Awhile secure, happily insensible,<br>
It could not rest content with its own truth.<br>
For something on its nescient breast was born<br>
Condemned to see and know, to feel and love,<br>
It watched its acts, imagined a soul within;<br>
It groped for truth and dreamed of Self and God.<br>
When all unconscious was, then all was well.<br>
I, Death, was king and kept my regal state,<br>
Designing my unwilled, unerring plan,<br>
Creating with a calm insentient heart.<br>
In my sovereign power of unreality<br>
Obliging nothingness to take a form,<br>
Infallibly my blind unthinking force<br>
Making by chance a fixity like fate’s,<br>
By whim the formulas of Necessity,<br>
Founded on the hollow ground of the Inane<br>
The sure bizarrerie of Nature’s scheme.<br>
I curved the vacant ether into Space;<br>
A huge expanding and contracting Breath<br>
Harboured the fires of the universe:<br>
I struck out the supreme original spark<br>
And spread its sparse ranked armies through the Inane,<br>
Manufactured the stars from the occult radiances,<br>
Marshalled the platoons of the invisible dance;<br>
I formed earth’s beauty out of atom and gas,<br>
And built from chemic plasm the living man.<br>
Then Thought came in and spoiled the harmonious world:<br>
Matter began to hope and think and feel,<br>
Tissue and nerve bore joy and agony.<br>
The inconscient cosmos strove to learn its task;<br>
An ignorant personal God was born in Mind<br>
And to understand invented reason’s law,<br>
The impersonal Vast throbbed back to man’s desire,<br>
A trouble rocked the great world’s blind still heart<br>
And Nature lost her wide immortal calm.<br>
Thus came this warped incomprehensible scene<br>
<br>
617<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
Of souls emmeshed in life’s delight and pain<br>
And Matter’s sleep and Mind’s mortality,<br>
Of beings in Nature’s prison waiting death<br>
And consciousness left in seeking ignorance<br>
And evolution’s slow arrested plan.<br>
This is the world in which thou mov’st, astray<br>
In the tangled pathways of the human mind,<br>
In the issueless circling of thy human life,<br>
Searching for thy soul and thinking God is here.<br>
But where is room for soul or place for God<br>
In the brute immensity of a machine?<br>
A transient Breath thou takest for thy soul,<br>
Born from a gas, a plasm, a sperm, a gene,<br>
A magnified image of man’s mind for God,<br>
A shadow of thyself thrown upon Space.<br>
Interposed between the upper and nether Void,<br>
Thy consciousness reflects the world around<br>
In the distorting mirror of Ignorance<br>
Or upwards turns to catch imagined stars.<br>
Or if a half-Truth is playing with the earth<br>
Throwing its light on a dark shadowy ground,<br>
It touches only and leaves a luminous smudge.<br>
Immortality thou claimest for thy spirit,<br>
But immortality for imperfect man,<br>
A god who hurts himself at every step,<br>
Would be a cycle of eternal pain.<br>
Wisdom and love thou claimest as thy right;<br>
But knowledge in this world is error’s mate,<br>
A brilliant procuress of Nescience,<br>
And human love a posturer on earth-stage<br>
Who imitates with verve a faery dance.<br>
An extract pressed from hard experience,<br>
Man’s knowledge casked in the barrels of Memory<br>
Has the harsh savour of a mortal draught:<br>
A sweet secretion from the erotic glands<br>
Flattering and torturing the burning nerves,<br>
<br>
618<br>
<br>
CANTO II: The Gospel of Death and Vanity of the Ideal<br>
<br>
Love is a honey and poison in the breast<br>
Drunk by it as the nectar of the gods.<br>
Earth’s human wisdom is no great-browed power,<br>
And love no gleaming angel from the skies;<br>
If they aspire beyond earth’s dullard air,<br>
Arriving sunwards with frail waxen wings,<br>
How high could reach that forced unnatural flight?<br>
But not on earth can divine wisdom reign<br>
And not on earth can divine love be found;<br>
Heaven-born, only in heaven can they live;<br>
Or else there too perhaps they are shining dreams.<br>
Nay, is not all thou art and doest a dream?<br>
Thy mind and life are tricks of Matter’s force.<br>
If thy mind seems to thee a radiant sun,<br>
If thy life runs a swift and glorious stream,<br>
This is the illusion of thy mortal heart<br>
Dazzled by a ray of happiness or light.<br>
Impotent to live by their own right divine,<br>
Convinced of their brilliant unreality,<br>
When their supporting ground is cut away,<br>
These children of Matter into Matter die.<br>
Even Matter vanishes into Energy’s vague<br>
And Energy is a motion of old Nought.<br>
How shall the Ideal’s unsubstantial hues<br>
Be painted stiff on earth’s vermilion blur,<br>
A dream within a dream come doubly true?<br>
How shall the will-o’-the-wisp become a star?<br>
The Ideal is a malady of thy mind,<br>
A bright delirium of thy speech and thought,<br>
A strange wine of beauty lifting thee to false sight.<br>
A noble fiction of thy yearnings made,<br>
Thy human imperfection it must share:<br>
Its forms in Nature disappoint the heart,<br>
And never shall it find its heavenly shape<br>
And never can it be fulfilled in Time.<br>
O soul misled by the splendour of thy thoughts,<br>
<br>
619<br>

<br>
O earthly creature with thy dream of heaven,<br>
Obey, resigned and still, the earthly law.<br>
Accept the brief light that falls upon thy days;<br>
Take what thou canst of Life’s permitted joy;<br>
Submitting to the ordeal of fate’s scourge<br>
Suffer what thou must of toil and grief and care.<br>
There shall approach silencing thy passionate heart<br>
My long calm night of everlasting sleep:<br>
There into the hush from which thou cam’st retire.”<br>

Canto Three<br>
<br>
The Debate of Love and Death<br>
A SAD destroying cadence the voice sank;<br>
It seemed to lead the advancing march of Life<br>
Into some still original Inane.<br>
But Savitri answered to almighty Death:<br>
“O dark-browed sophist of the universe<br>
Who veilst the Real with its own Idea,<br>
Hiding with brute objects Nature’s living face,<br>
Masking eternity with thy dance of death,<br>
Thou hast woven the ignorant mind into a screen<br>
And made of Thought error’s purveyor and scribe,<br>
And a false witness of mind’s servant sense.<br>
An aesthete of the sorrow of the world,<br>
Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy<br>
Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light<br>
And called in Truth to vindicate a lie.<br>
A lying reality is falsehood’s crown<br>
And a perverted truth her richest gem.<br>
O Death, thou speakest truth but truth that slays,<br>
I answer to thee with the Truth that saves.<br>
A traveller new-discovering himself,<br>
One made of Matter’s world his starting-point,<br>
He made of Nothingness his living-room<br>
And Night a process of the eternal light<br>
And death a spur towards immortality.<br>
God wrapped his head from sight in Matter’s cowl,<br>
His consciousness dived into inconscient depths,<br>
All-Knowledge seemed a huge dark Nescience;<br>
Infinity wore a boundless zero’s form.<br>
His abysms of bliss became insensible deeps,<br>
Eternity a blank spiritual Vast.<br>
Annulling an original nullity<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
The Timeless took its ground in emptiness<br>
And drew the figure of a universe,<br>
That the spirit might adventure into Time<br>
And wrestle with adamant Necessity<br>
And the soul pursue a cosmic pilgrimage.<br>
A spirit moved in black immensities<br>
And built a Thought in ancient Nothingness;<br>
A soul was lit in God’s tremendous Void,<br>
A secret labouring glow of nascent fire.<br>
In Nihil’s gulf his mighty Puissance wrought;<br>
She swung her formless motion into shapes,<br>
Made Matter the body of the Bodiless.<br>
Infant and dim the eternal Mights awoke.<br>
In inert Matter breathed a slumbering Life,<br>
In a subconscient Life Mind lay asleep;<br>
In waking Life it stretched its giant limbs<br>
To shake from it the torpor of its drowse;<br>
A senseless substance quivered into sense,<br>
The world’s heart commenced to beat, its eyes to see,<br>
In the crowded dumb vibrations of a brain<br>
Thought fumbled in a ring to find itself,<br>
Discovered speech and fed the new-born Word<br>
That bridged with spans of light the world’s ignorance.<br>
In waking Mind, the Thinker built his house.<br>
A reasoning animal willed and planned and sought;<br>
He stood erect among his brute compeers,<br>
He built life new, measured the universe,<br>
Opposed his fate and wrestled with unseen Powers,<br>
Conquered and used the laws that rule the world,<br>
And hoped to ride the heavens and reach the stars,<br>
A master of his huge environment.<br>
Now through Mind’s windows stares the demigod<br>
Hidden behind the curtains of man’s soul:<br>
He has seen the Unknown, looked on Truth’s veilless face;<br>
A ray has touched him from the eternal sun;<br>
Motionless, voiceless in foreseeing depths,<br>
<br>
622<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Debate of Love and Death<br>
<br>
He stands awake in Supernature’s light<br>
And sees a glory of arisen wings<br>
And sees the vast descending might of God.<br>
“O Death, thou lookst on an unfinished world<br>
Assailed by thee and of its road unsure,<br>
Peopled by imperfect minds and ignorant lives,<br>
And sayest God is not and all is vain.<br>
How shall the child already be the man?<br>
Because he is infant, shall he never grow?<br>
Because he is ignorant, shall he never learn?<br>
In a small fragile seed a great tree lurks,<br>
In a tiny gene a thinking being is shut;<br>
A little element in a little sperm,<br>
It grows and is a conqueror and a sage.<br>
Then wilt thou spew out, Death, God’s mystic truth,<br>
Deny the occult spiritual miracle?<br>
Still wilt thou say there is no spirit, no God?<br>
A mute material Nature wakes and sees;<br>
She has invented speech, unveiled a will.<br>
Something there waits beyond towards which she strives,<br>
Something surrounds her into which she grows:<br>
To uncover the spirit, to change back into God,<br>
To exceed herself is her transcendent task.<br>
In God concealed the world began to be,<br>
Tardily it travels towards manifest God:<br>
Our imperfection towards perfection toils,<br>
The body is the chrysalis of a soul:<br>
The infinite holds the finite in its arms,<br>
Time travels towards revealed eternity.<br>
A miracle structure of the eternal Mage,<br>
Matter its mystery hides from its own eyes,<br>
A scripture written out in cryptic signs,<br>
An occult document of the All-Wonderful’s art.<br>
All here bears witness to his secret might,<br>
In all we feel his presence and his power.<br>
A blaze of his sovereign glory is the sun,<br>
<br>
623<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
A glory is the gold and glimmering moon,<br>
A glory is his dream of purple sky.<br>
A march of his greatness are the wheeling stars.<br>
His laughter of beauty breaks out in green trees,<br>
His moments of beauty triumph in a flower;<br>
The blue sea’s chant, the rivulet’s wandering voice<br>
Are murmurs falling from the Eternal’s harp.<br>
This world is God fulfilled in outwardness.<br>
His ways challenge our reason and our sense;<br>
By blind brute movements of an ignorant Force,<br>
By means we slight as small, obscure or base,<br>
A greatness founded upon little things,<br>
He has built a world in the unknowing Void.<br>
His forms he has massed from infinitesimal dust;<br>
His marvels are built from insignificant things.<br>
If mind is crippled, life untaught and crude,<br>
If brutal masks are there and evil acts,<br>
They are incidents of his vast and varied plot,<br>
His great and dangerous drama’s needed steps;<br>
He makes with these and all his passion-play,<br>
A play and yet no play but the deep scheme<br>
Of a transcendent Wisdom finding ways<br>
To meet her Lord in the shadow and the Night:<br>
Above her is the vigil of the stars;<br>
Watched by a solitary Infinitude<br>
She embodies in dumb Matter the Divine,<br>
In symbol minds and lives the Absolute.<br>
A miracle-monger her mechanical craft;<br>
Matter’s machine worked out the laws of thought,<br>
Life’s engines served the labour of a soul:<br>
The Mighty Mother her creation wrought,<br>
A huge caprice self-bound by iron laws,<br>
And shut God into an enigmatic world:<br>
She lulled the Omniscient into nescient sleep,<br>
Omnipotence on Inertia’s back she drove,<br>
Trod perfectly with divine unconscious steps<br>
<br>
624<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Debate of Love and Death<br>
<br>
The enormous circle of her wonder-works.<br>
Immortality assured itself by death;<br>
The Eternal’s face was seen through drifts of Time.<br>
His knowledge he disguised as Ignorance,<br>
His Good he sowed in Evil’s monstrous bed,<br>
Made error a door by which Truth could enter in,<br>
His plant of bliss watered with Sorrow’s tears.<br>
A thousand aspects point back to the One;<br>
A dual Nature covered the Unique.<br>
In this meeting of the Eternal’s mingling masques,<br>
This tangle-dance of passionate contraries<br>
Locking like lovers in a forbidden embrace<br>
The quarrel of their lost identity,<br>
Through this wrestle and wrangle of the extremes of Power<br>
Earth’s million roads struggled towards deity.<br>
All stumbled on behind a stumbling Guide,<br>
Yet every stumble is a needed pace<br>
On unknown routes to an unknowable goal.<br>
All blundered and straggled towards the One Divine.<br>
As if transmuted by a titan spell<br>
The eternal Powers assumed a dubious face:<br>
Idols of an oblique divinity,<br>
They wore the heads of animal or troll,<br>
Assumed ears of the faun, the satyr’s hoof,<br>
Or harboured the demoniac in their gaze:<br>
A crooked maze they made of thinking mind,<br>
They suffered a metamorphosis of the heart,<br>
Admitting bacchant revellers from the Night<br>
Into its sanctuary of delights,<br>
As in a Dionysian masquerade.<br>
On the highways, in the gardens of the world<br>
They wallowed oblivious of their divine parts,<br>
As drunkards of a dire Circean wine<br>
Or a child who sprawls and sports in Nature’s mire.<br>
Even wisdom, hewer of the roads of God,<br>
Is a partner in the deep disastrous game:<br>

BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
Lost is the pilgrim’s wallet and the scrip,<br>
She fails to read the map and watch the star.<br>
A poor self-righteous virtue is her stock<br>
And reason’s pragmatic grope or abstract sight,<br>
Or the technique of a brief hour’s success<br>
She teaches, an usher in utility’s school.<br>
On the ocean surface of vast Consciousness<br>
Small thoughts in shoals are fished up into a net<br>
But the great truths escape her narrow cast;<br>
Guarded from vision by creation’s depths,<br>
Obscure they swim in blind enormous gulfs<br>
Safe from the little sounding leads of mind,<br>
Too far for the puny diver’s shallow plunge.<br>
Our mortal vision peers with ignorant eyes;<br>
It has no gaze on the deep heart of things.<br>
Our knowledge walks leaning on Error’s staff,<br>
A worshipper of false dogmas and false gods,<br>
Or fanatic of a fierce intolerant creed<br>
Or a seeker doubting every truth he finds,<br>
A sceptic facing Light with adamant No<br>
Or chilling the heart with dry ironic smile,<br>
A cynic stamping out the god in man;<br>
A darkness wallows in the paths of Time<br>
Or lifts its giant head to blot the stars;<br>
It makes a cloud of the interpreting mind<br>
And intercepts the oracles of the Sun.<br>
Yet Light is there; it stands at Nature’s doors:<br>
It holds a torch to lead the traveller in.<br>
It waits to be kindled in our secret cells;<br>
It is a star lighting an ignorant sea,<br>
A lamp upon our poop piercing the night.<br>
As knowledge grows Light flames up from within:<br>
It is a shining warrior in the mind,<br>
An eagle of dreams in the divining heart,<br>
An armour in the fight, a bow of God.<br>
Then larger dawns arrive and Wisdom’s pomps<br>

<br>
Cross through the being’s dim half-lighted fields;<br>
Philosophy climbs up Thought’s cloud-bank peaks<br>
And Science tears out Nature’s occult powers,<br>
Enormous djinns who serve a dwarf’s small needs,<br>
Exposes the sealed minutiae of her art<br>
And conquers her by her own captive force.<br>
On heights unreached by mind’s most daring soar,<br>
Upon a dangerous edge of failing Time<br>
The soul draws back into its deathless Self;<br>
Man’s knowledge becomes God’s supernal Ray.<br>
There is the mystic realm whence leaps the power<br>
Whose fire burns in the eyes of seer and sage;<br>
A lightning flash of visionary sight,<br>
It plays upon an inward verge of mind:<br>
Thought silenced gazes into a brilliant Void.<br>
A voice comes down from mystic unseen peaks:<br>
A cry of splendour from a mouth of storm,<br>
It is the voice that speaks to night’s profound,<br>
It is the thunder and the flaming call.<br>
Above the planes that climb from nescient earth,<br>
A hand is lifted towards the Invisible’s realm,<br>
Beyond the superconscient’s blinding line<br>
And plucks away the screens of the Unknown;<br>
A spirit within looks into the Eternal’s eyes.<br>
It hears the Word to which our hearts were deaf,<br>
It sees through the blaze in which our thoughts grew blind;<br>
It drinks from the naked breasts of glorious Truth,<br>
It learns the secrets of eternity.<br>
Thus all was plunged into the riddling Night,<br>
Thus all is raised to meet a dazzling Sun.<br>
O Death, this is the mystery of thy reign.<br>
In earth’s anomalous and magic field<br>
Carried in its aimless journey by the sun<br>
Mid the forced marches of the great dumb stars,<br>
A darkness occupied the fields of God,<br>
And Matter’s world was governed by thy shape.<br>
<br>
627<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
Thy mask has covered the Eternal’s face,<br>
The Bliss that made the world has fallen asleep.<br>
Abandoned in the Vast she slumbered on:<br>
An evil transmutation overtook<br>
Her members till she knew herself no more.<br>
Only through her creative slumber flit<br>
Frail memories of the joy and beauty meant<br>
Under the sky’s blue laugh mid green-scarfed trees<br>
And happy squanderings of scents and hues,<br>
In the field of the golden promenade of the sun<br>
And the vigil of the dream-light of the stars,<br>
Amid high meditating heads of hills,<br>
On the bosom of voluptuous rain-kissed earth<br>
And by the sapphire tumblings of the sea.<br>
But now the primal innocence is lost<br>
And Death and Ignorance govern the mortal world<br>
And Nature’s visage wears a greyer hue.<br>
Earth still has kept her early charm and grace,<br>
The grandeur and the beauty still are hers,<br>
But veiled is the divine Inhabitant.<br>
The souls of men have wandered from the Light<br>
And the great Mother turns away her face.<br>
The eyes of the creatrix Bliss are closed<br>
And sorrow’s touch has found her in her dreams.<br>
As she turns and tosses on her bed of Void,<br>
Because she cannot wake and find herself<br>
And cannot build again her perfect shape,<br>
Oblivious of her nature and her state,<br>
Forgetting her instinct of felicity,<br>
Forgetting to create a world of joy,<br>
She weeps and makes her creatures’ eyes to weep;<br>
Testing with sorrow’s edge her children’s breasts,<br>
She spends on life’s vain waste of hope and toil<br>
The poignant luxury of grief and tears.<br>
In the nightmare change of her half-conscious dream,<br>
Tortured herself and torturing by her touch,<br>

She comes to our hearts and bodies and our lives<br>
Wearing a hard and cruel mask of pain.<br>
Our nature twisted by the abortive birth<br>
Returns wry answers to life’s questioning shocks,<br>
An acrid relish finds in the world’s pangs,<br>
Drinks the sharp wine of grief’s perversity.<br>
A curse is laid on the pure joy of life:<br>
Delight, God’s sweetest sign and Beauty’s twin,<br>
Dreaded by aspiring saint and austere sage,<br>
Is shunned, a dangerous and ambiguous cheat,<br>
A specious trick of an infernal Power<br>
It tempts the soul to its self-hurt and fall.<br>
A puritan God made pleasure a poisonous fruit,<br>
Or red drug in the market-place of Death,<br>
And sin the child of Nature’s ecstasy.<br>
Yet every creature hunts for happiness,<br>
Buys with harsh pangs or tears by violence<br>
From the dull breast of the inanimate globe<br>
Some fragment or some broken shard of bliss.<br>
Even joy itself becomes a poisonous draught;<br>
Its hunger is made a dreadful hook of Fate.<br>
All means are held good to catch a single beam,<br>
Eternity sacrificed for a moment’s bliss:<br>
Yet for joy and not for sorrow earth was made<br>
And not as a dream in endless suffering Time.<br>
Although God made the world for his delight,<br>
An ignorant Power took charge and seemed his Will<br>
And Death’s deep falsity has mastered Life.<br>
All grew a play of Chance simulating Fate.<br>
“A secret air of pure felicity<br>
Deep like a sapphire heaven our spirits breathe;<br>
Our hearts and bodies feel its obscure call,<br>
Our senses grope for it and touch and lose.<br>
If this withdrew, the world would sink in the Void;<br>
If this were not, nothing could move or live.<br>

A hidden Bliss is at the root of things.<br>
A mute Delight regards Time’s countless works:<br>
To house God’s joy in things Space gave wide room,<br>
To house God’s joy in self our souls were born.<br>
This universe an old enchantment guards;<br>
Its objects are carved cups of World-Delight<br>
Whose charmed wine is some deep soul’s rapture-drink:<br>
The All-Wonderful has packed heaven with his dreams,<br>
He has made blank ancient Space his marvel-house;<br>
He spilled his spirit into Matter’s signs:<br>
His fires of grandeur burn in the great sun,<br>
He glides through heaven shimmering in the moon;<br>
He is beauty carolling in the fields of sound;<br>
He chants the stanzas of the odes of Wind;<br>
He is silence watching in the stars at night;<br>
He wakes at dawn and calls from every bough,<br>
Lies stunned in the stone and dreams in flower and tree.<br>
Even in this labour and dolour of Ignorance,<br>
On the hard perilous ground of difficult earth,<br>
In spite of death and evil circumstance<br>
A will to live persists, a joy to be.<br>
There is a joy in all that meets the sense,<br>
A joy in all experience of the soul,<br>
A joy in evil and a joy in good,<br>
A joy in virtue and a joy in sin:<br>
Indifferent to the threat of Karmic law,<br>
Joy dares to grow upon forbidden soil,<br>
Its sap runs through the plant and flowers of Pain:<br>
It thrills with the drama of fate and tragic doom,<br>
It tears its food from sorrow and ecstasy,<br>
On danger and difficulty whets its strength;<br>
It wallows with the reptile and the worm<br>
And lifts its head, an equal of the stars;<br>
It shares the faeries’ dance, dines with the gnome:<br>
It basks in the light and heat of many suns,<br>
The sun of Beauty and the sun of Power<br>

It grows towards the Titan and the God.<br>
On earth it lingers drinking its deep fill,<br>
Through the symbol of her pleasure and her pain,<br>
Of the grapes of Heaven and the flowers of the Abyss,<br>
Of the flame-stabs and the torment-craft of Hell<br>
And dim fragments of the glory of Paradise.<br>
In the small paltry pleasures of man’s life,<br>
In his petty passions and joys it finds a taste,<br>
A taste in tears and torture of broken hearts,<br>
In the crown of gold and in the crown of thorns,<br>
In life’s nectar of sweetness and its bitter wine.<br>
All being it explores for unknown bliss,<br>
Sounds all experience for things new and strange.<br>
Life brings into the earthly creature’s days<br>
A tongue of glory from a brighter sphere:<br>
It deepens in his musings and his Art,<br>
It leaps at the splendour of some perfect word,<br>
It exults in his high resolves and noble deeds,<br>
Wanders in his errors, dares the abyss’s brink,<br>
It climbs in his climbings, wallows in his fall.<br>
Angel and demon brides his chamber share,<br>
Possessors or competitors for life’s heart.<br>
To the enjoyer of the cosmic scene<br>
His greatness and his littleness equal are,<br>
His magnanimity and meanness hues<br>
Cast on some neutral background of the gods:<br>
The Artist’s skill he admires who planned it all.<br>
But not for ever endures this danger game:<br>
Beyond the earth, but meant for delivered earth,<br>
Wisdom and joy prepare their perfect crown;<br>
Truth superhuman calls to thinking man.<br>
At last the soul turns to eternal things,<br>
In every shrine it cries for the clasp of God.<br>
Then is there played the crowning Mystery,<br>
Then is achieved the longed-for miracle.<br>

Immortal Bliss her wide celestial eyes<br>
Opens on the stars, she stirs her mighty limbs;<br>
Time thrills to the sapphics of her amour-song<br>
And Space fills with a white beatitude.<br>
Then leaving to its grief the human heart,<br>
Abandoning speech and the name-determined realms,<br>
Through a gleaming far-seen sky of wordless thought,<br>
Through naked thought-free heavens of absolute sight,<br>
She climbs to the summits where the unborn Idea<br>
Remembering the future that must be<br>
Looks down upon the works of labouring Force,<br>
Immutable above the world it made.<br>
In the vast golden laughter of Truth’s sun<br>
Like a great heaven-bird on a motionless sea<br>
Is poised her winged ardour of creative joy<br>
On the still deep of the Eternal’s peace.<br>
This was the aim, this the supernal Law,<br>
Nature’s allotted task when beauty-drenched<br>
In dim mist-waters of inconscient sleep,<br>
Out of the Void this grand creation rose, —<br>
For this the Spirit came into the Abyss<br>
And charged with its power Matter’s unknowing force,<br>
In Night’s bare session to cathedral Light,<br>
In Death’s realm repatriate immortality.<br>
A mystic slow transfiguration works.<br>
All our earth starts from mud and ends in sky,<br>
And Love that was once an animal’s desire,<br>
Then a sweet madness in the rapturous heart,<br>
An ardent comradeship in the happy mind,<br>
Becomes a wide spiritual yearning’s space.<br>
A lonely soul passions for the Alone,<br>
The heart that loved man thrills to the love of God,<br>
A body is his chamber and his shrine.<br>
Then is our being rescued from separateness;<br>
All is itself, all is new-felt in God:<br>

<br>
Gathers the whole world into his single breast.<br>
Then shall the business fail of Night and Death:<br>
When unity is won, when strife is lost<br>
And all is known and all is clasped by Love<br>
Who would turn back to ignorance and pain?<br>
“O Death, I have triumphed over thee within;<br>
I quiver no more with the assault of grief;<br>
A mighty calmness seated deep within<br>
Has occupied my body and my sense:<br>
It takes the world’s grief and transmutes to strength,<br>
It makes the world’s joy one with the joy of God.<br>
My love eternal sits throned on God’s calm;<br>
For Love must soar beyond the very heavens<br>
And find its secret sense ineffable;<br>
It must change its human ways to ways divine,<br>
Yet keep its sovereignty of earthly bliss.<br>
O Death, not for my heart’s sweet poignancy<br>
Nor for my happy body’s bliss alone<br>
I have claimed from thee the living Satyavan,<br>
But for his work and mine, our sacred charge.<br>
Our lives are God’s messengers beneath the stars;<br>
To dwell under death’s shadow they have come<br>
Tempting God’s light to earth for the ignorant race,<br>
His love to fill the hollow in men’s hearts,<br>
His bliss to heal the unhappiness of the world.<br>
For I, the woman, am the force of God,<br>
He the Eternal’s delegate soul in man.<br>
My will is greater than thy law, O Death;<br>
My love is stronger than the bonds of Fate:<br>
Our love is the heavenly seal of the Supreme.<br>
I guard that seal against thy rending hands.<br>
Love must not cease to live upon the earth;<br>
For Love is the bright link twixt earth and heaven,<br>
Love is the far Transcendent’s angel here;<br>
Love is man’s lien on the Absolute.”<br>
But to the woman Death the god replied,<br>
<br>
633<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
With the ironic laughter of his voice<br>
Discouraging the labour of the stars:<br>
“Even so men cheat the Truth with splendid thoughts.<br>
Thus wilt thou hire the glorious charlatan, Mind,<br>
To weave from his Ideal’s gossamer air<br>
A fine raiment for thy body’s nude desires<br>
And thy heart’s clutching greedy passion clothe?<br>
Daub not the web of life with magic hues:<br>
Make rather thy thought a plain and faithful glass<br>
Reflecting Matter and mortality,<br>
And know thy soul a product of the flesh,<br>
A made-up self in a constructed world.<br>
Thy words are large murmurs in a mystic dream.<br>
For how in the soiled heart of man could dwell<br>
The immaculate grandeur of thy dream-built God,<br>
Or who can see a face and form divine<br>
In the naked two-legged worm thou callest man?<br>
O human face, put off mind-painted masks:<br>
The animal be, the worm that Nature meant;<br>
Accept thy futile birth, thy narrow life.<br>
For truth is bare like stone and hard like death;<br>
Bare in the bareness, hard with truth’s hardness live.”<br>
But Savitri replied to the dire God:<br>
“Yes, I am human. Yet shall man by me,<br>
Since in humanity waits his hour the God,<br>
Trample thee down to reach the immortal heights,<br>
Transcending grief and pain and fate and death.<br>
Yes, my humanity is a mask of God:<br>
He dwells in me, the mover of my acts,<br>
Turning the great wheel of his cosmic work.<br>
I am the living body of his light,<br>
I am the thinking instrument of his power,<br>
I incarnate Wisdom in an earthly breast,<br>
I am his conquering and unslayable will.<br>
The formless Spirit drew in me its shape;<br>
In me are the Nameless and the secret Name.”<br>
<br>
634<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Debate of Love and Death<br>
<br>
Death from the incredulous Darkness sent its cry:<br>
“O priestess in Imagination’s house,<br>
Persuade first Nature’s fixed immutable laws<br>
And make the impossible thy daily work.<br>
How canst thou force to wed two eternal foes?<br>
Irreconcilable in their embrace<br>
They cancel the glory of their pure extremes:<br>
An unhappy wedlock maims their stunted force.<br>
How shall thy will make one the true and false?<br>
Where Matter is all, there Spirit is a dream:<br>
If all are the Spirit, Matter is a lie,<br>
And who was the liar who forged the universe?<br>
The Real with the unreal cannot mate.<br>
He who would turn to God, must leave the world;<br>
He who would live in the Spirit, must give up life;<br>
He who has met the Self, renounces self.<br>
The voyagers of the million routes of mind<br>
Who have travelled through Existence to its end,<br>
Sages exploring the world-ocean’s vasts,<br>
Have found extinction the sole harbour safe.<br>
Two only are the doors of man’s escape,<br>
Death of his body Matter’s gate to peace,<br>
Death of his soul his last felicity.<br>
In me all take refuge, for I, Death, am God.”<br>
But Savitri replied to mighty Death:<br>
“My heart is wiser than the Reason’s thoughts,<br>
My heart is stronger than thy bonds, O Death.<br>
It sees and feels the one Heart beat in all,<br>
It feels the high Transcendent’s sunlike hands,<br>
It sees the cosmic Spirit at its work;<br>
In the dim Night it lies alone with God.<br>
My heart’s strength can carry the grief of the universe<br>
And never falter from its luminous track,<br>
Its white tremendous orbit through God’s peace.<br>
It can drink up the sea of All-Delight<br>
And never lose the white spiritual touch,<br>
<br>
635<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
The calm that broods in the deep Infinite.”<br>
He said, “Art thou indeed so strong, O heart,<br>
O soul, so free? And canst thou gather then<br>
Bright pleasure from my wayside flowering boughs,<br>
Yet falter not from thy hard journey’s goal,<br>
Meet the world’s dangerous touch and never fall?<br>
Show me thy strength and freedom from my laws.”<br>
But Savitri answered, “Surely I shall find<br>
Among the green and whispering woods of Life<br>
Close-bosomed pleasures, only mine since his,<br>
Or mine for him, because our joys are one.<br>
And if I linger, Time is ours and God’s,<br>
And if I fall, is not his hand near mine?<br>
All is a single plan; each wayside act<br>
Deepens the soul’s response, brings nearer the goal.”<br>
Death the contemptuous Nihil answered her:<br>
“So prove thy absolute force to the wise gods,<br>
By choosing earthly joy! For self demand<br>
And yet from self and its gross masks live free.<br>
Then will I give thee all thy soul desires,<br>
All the brief joys earth keeps for mortal hearts.<br>
Only the one dearest wish that outweighs all,<br>
Hard laws forbid and thy ironic fate.<br>
My will once wrought remains unchanged through Time,<br>
And Satyavan can never again be thine.”<br>
But Savitri replied to the vague Power:<br>
“If the eyes of Darkness can look straight at Truth,<br>
Look in my heart and, knowing what I am,<br>
Give what thou wilt or what thou must, O Death.<br>
Nothing I claim but Satyavan alone.”<br>
There was a hush as if of doubtful fates.<br>
As one disdainful still who yields a point<br>
Death bowed his sovereign head in cold assent:<br>
“I give to thee, saved from death and poignant fate<br>
Whatever once the living Satyavan<br>
Desired in his heart for Savitri.<br>
<br>
636<br>
<br>
CANTO III: The Debate of Love and Death<br>
<br>
Bright noons I give thee and unwounded dawns,<br>
Daughters of thy own shape in heart and mind,<br>
Fair hero sons and sweetness undisturbed<br>
Of union with thy husband dear and true.<br>
And thou shalt harvest in thy joyful house<br>
Felicity of thy surrounded eves.<br>
Love shall bind by thee many gathered hearts.<br>
The opposite sweetness in thy days shall meet<br>
Of tender service to thy life’s desired<br>
And loving empire over all thy loved,<br>
Two poles of bliss made one, O Savitri.<br>
Return, O child, to thy forsaken earth.”<br>
But Savitri replied, “Thy gifts resist.<br>
Earth cannot flower if lonely I return.”<br>
Then Death sent forth once more his angry cry,<br>
As chides a lion his escaping prey:<br>
“What knowst thou of earth’s rich and changing life<br>
Who thinkst that one man dead all joy must cease?<br>
Hope not to be unhappy till the end:<br>
For grief dies soon in the tired human heart;<br>
Soon other guests the empty chambers fill.<br>
A transient painting on a holiday’s floor<br>
Traced for a moment’s beauty love was made.<br>
Or if a voyager on the eternal trail,<br>
Its objects fluent change in its embrace<br>
Like waves to a swimmer upon infinite seas.”<br>
But Savitri replied to the vague god,<br>
“Give me back Satyavan, my only lord.<br>
Thy thoughts are vacant to my soul that feels<br>
The deep eternal truth in transient things.”<br>
Death answered her, “Return and try thy soul!<br>
Soon shalt thou find appeased that other men<br>
On lavish earth have beauty, strength and truth,<br>
And when thou hast half forgotten, one of these<br>
Shall wind himself around thy heart that needs<br>
Some human answering heart against thy breast;<br>
<br>
637<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
For who, being mortal, can dwell glad alone?<br>
Then Satyavan shall glide into the past,<br>
A gentle memory pushed away from thee<br>
By new love and thy children’s tender hands,<br>
Till thou shalt wonder if thou lov’dst at all.<br>
Such is the life earth’s travail has conceived,<br>
A constant stream that never is the same.”<br>
But Savitri replied to mighty Death:<br>
“O dark ironic critic of God’s work,<br>
Thou mockst the mind and body’s faltering search<br>
For what the heart holds in a prophet hour<br>
And the immortal spirit shall make its own.<br>
Mine is a heart that worshipped, though forsaken,<br>
The image of the god its love adored;<br>
I have burned in flame to travel in his steps.<br>
Are we not they who bore vast solitude<br>
Seated upon the hills alone with God?<br>
Why dost thou vainly strive with me, O Death,<br>
A mind delivered from all twilight thoughts,<br>
To whom the secrets of the gods are plain?<br>
For now at last I know beyond all doubt,<br>
The great stars burn with my unceasing fire<br>
And life and death are both its fuel made.<br>
Life only was my blind attempt to love:<br>
Earth saw my struggle, heaven my victory;<br>
All shall be seized, transcended; there shall kiss<br>
Casting their veils before the marriage fire<br>
The eternal bridegroom and eternal bride.<br>
The heavens accept our broken flights at last.<br>
On our life’s prow that breaks the waves of Time<br>
No signal light of hope has gleamed in vain.”<br>
She spoke; the boundless members of the god<br>
As if by secret ecstasy assailed,<br>
Shuddered in silence as obscurely stir<br>
Ocean’s dim fields delivered to the moon.<br>
Then lifted up as by a sudden wind<br>
<br>
638<br>

Around her in that vague and glimmering world<br>
The twilight trembled like a bursting veil.<br>
Thus with armed speech the great opponents strove.<br>
Around those spirits in the glittering mist<br>
A deepening half-light fled with pearly wings<br>
As if to reach some far ideal Morn.<br>
Outlined her thoughts flew through the gleaming haze<br>
Mingling bright-pinioned with its lights and veils<br>
And all her words like dazzling jewels were caught<br>
Into the glow of a mysterious world,<br>
Or tricked in the rainbow shifting of its hues<br>
Like echoes swam fainting into far sound.<br>
All utterance, all mood must there become<br>
An unenduring tissue sewn by mind<br>
To make a gossamer robe of beautiful change.<br>
Intent upon her silent will she walked<br>
On the dim grass of vague unreal plains,<br>
A floating veil of visions in her front,<br>
A trailing robe of dreams behind her feet.<br>
But now her spirit’s flame of conscient force<br>
Retiring from a sweetness without fruit<br>
Called back her thoughts from speech to sit within<br>
In a deep room in meditation’s house.<br>
For only there could dwell the soul’s firm truth:<br>
Imperishable, a tongue of sacrifice,<br>
It flamed unquenched upon the central hearth<br>
Where burns for the high houselord and his mate<br>
The homestead’s sentinel and witness fire<br>
From which the altars of the gods are lit.<br>
All still compelled went gliding on unchanged,<br>
Still was the order of these worlds reversed:<br>
The mortal led, the god and spirit obeyed<br>
And she behind was leader of their march<br>
And they in front were followers of her will.<br>
Onward they journeyed through the drifting ways<br>
Vaguely companioned by the glimmering mists.<br>
<br>
639<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
640<br>
<br>
But faster now all fled as if perturbed<br>
Escaping from the clearness of her soul.<br>
A heaven-bird upon jewelled wings of wind<br>
Borne like a coloured and embosomed fire,<br>
By spirits carried in a pearl-hued cave,<br>
On through the enchanted dimness moved her soul.<br>
Death walked in front of her and Satyavan,<br>
In the dark front of Death, a failing star.<br>
Above was the unseen balance of his fate.<br>

<br>
The Dream Twilight of the Earthly Real<br>
THERE came a slope that slowly downward sank;<br>
It slipped towards a stumbling grey descent.<br>
The dim-heart marvel of the ideal was lost;<br>
Its crowding wonder of bright delicate dreams<br>
And vague half-limned sublimities she had left:<br>
Thought fell towards lower levels; hard and tense<br>
It passioned for some crude reality.<br>
The twilight floated still but changed its hues<br>
And heavily swathed a less delightful dream;<br>
It settled in tired masses on the air;<br>
Its symbol colours tuned with duller reds<br>
And almost seemed a lurid mist of day.<br>
A straining taut and dire besieged her heart;<br>
Heavy her sense grew with a dangerous load,<br>
And sadder, greater sounds were in her ears,<br>
And through stern breakings of the lambent glare<br>
Her vision caught a hurry of driving plains<br>
And cloudy mountains and wide tawny streams,<br>
And cities climbed in minarets and towers<br>
Towards an unavailing changeless sky:<br>
Long quays and ghauts and harbours white with sails<br>
Challenged her sight awhile and then were gone.<br>
Amidst them travailed toiling multitudes<br>
In ever shifting perishable groups,<br>
A foiled cinema of lit shadowy shapes<br>
Enveloped in the grey mantle of a dream.<br>
Imagining meanings in life’s heavy drift,<br>
They trusted in the uncertain environment<br>
And waited for death to change their spirit’s scene.<br>
A savage din of labour and a tramp<br>
Of armoured life and the monotonous hum<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
Of thoughts and acts that ever were the same,<br>
As if the dull reiterated drone<br>
Of a great brute machine, beset her soul, —<br>
A grey dissatisfied rumour like a ghost<br>
Of the moaning of a loud unquiet sea.<br>
A huge inhuman cyclopean voice,<br>
A Babel-builders’ song towering to heaven,<br>
A throb of engines and the clang of tools<br>
Brought the deep undertone of labour’s pain.<br>
As when pale lightnings tear a tortured sky,<br>
High overhead a cloud-rimmed series flared<br>
Chasing like smoke from a red funnel driven,<br>
The forced creations of an ignorant Mind:<br>
Drifting she saw like pictured fragments flee<br>
Phantoms of human thought and baffled hopes,<br>
The shapes of Nature and the arts of man,<br>
Philosophies and disciplines and laws,<br>
And the dead spirit of old societies,<br>
Constructions of the Titan and the worm.<br>
As if lost remnants of forgotten light,<br>
Before her mind there fled with trailing wings<br>
Dimmed revelations and delivering words,<br>
Emptied of their mission and their strength to save,<br>
The messages of the evangelist gods,<br>
Voices of prophets, scripts of vanishing creeds.<br>
Each in its hour eternal claimed went by:<br>
Ideals, systems, sciences, poems, crafts<br>
Tireless there perished and again recurred,<br>
Sought restlessly by some creative Power;<br>
But all were dreams crossing an empty vast.<br>
Ascetic voices called of lonely seers<br>
On mountain summits or by river banks<br>
Or from the desolate heart of forest glades<br>
Seeking heaven’s rest or the spirit’s worldless peace,<br>
Or in bodies motionless like statues, fixed<br>
In tranced cessations of their sleepless thought<br>
<br>
642<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Dream Twilight of the Earthly Real<br>
<br>
Sat sleeping souls, and this too was a dream.<br>
All things the past has made and slain were there,<br>
Its lost forgotten forms that once had lived,<br>
And all the present loves as new-revealed<br>
And all the hopes the future brings had failed<br>
Already, caught and spent in efforts vain,<br>
Repeated fruitlessly age after age.<br>
Unwearied all returned insisting still<br>
Because of joy in the anguish of pursuit<br>
And joy to labour and to win and lose<br>
And joy to create and keep and joy to kill.<br>
The rolling cycles passed and came again,<br>
Brought the same toils and the same barren end,<br>
Forms ever new and ever old, the long<br>
Appalling revolutions of the world.<br>
Once more arose the great destroying Voice:<br>
Across the fruitless labour of the worlds<br>
His huge denial’s all-defeating might<br>
Pursued the ignorant march of dolorous Time.<br>
“Behold the figures of this symbol realm,<br>
Its solid outlines of creative dream<br>
Inspiring the great concrete tasks of earth.<br>
In its motion-parable of human life<br>
Here thou canst trace the outcome Nature gives<br>
To the sin of being and the error in things<br>
And the desire that compels to live<br>
And man’s incurable malady of hope.<br>
In an immutable order’s hierarchy<br>
Where Nature changes not, man cannot change:<br>
Ever he obeys her fixed mutation’s law;<br>
In a new version of her oft-told tale<br>
In ever-wheeling cycles turns the race.<br>
His mind is pent in circling boundaries:<br>
For mind is man, beyond thought he cannot soar.<br>
If he could leave his limits he would be safe:<br>

<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
He sees but cannot mount to his greater heavens;<br>
Even winged, he sinks back to his native soil.<br>
He is a captive in his net of mind<br>
And beats soul-wings against the walls of life.<br>
In vain his heart lifts up its yearning prayer,<br>
Peopling with brilliant Gods the formless Void;<br>
Then disappointed to the Void he turns<br>
And in its happy nothingness asks release,<br>
The calm Nirvana of his dream of self:<br>
The Word in silence ends, in Nought the name.<br>
Apart amid the mortal multitudes,<br>
He calls the Godhead incommunicable<br>
To be the lover of his lonely soul<br>
Or casts his spirit into its void embrace.<br>
Or he finds his copy in the impartial All;<br>
He imparts to the Immobile his own will,<br>
Attributes to the Eternal wrath and love<br>
And to the Ineffable lends a thousand names.<br>
Hope not to call God down into his life.<br>
How shalt thou bring the Everlasting here?<br>
There is no house for him in hurrying Time.<br>
Vainly thou seekst in Matter’s world an aim;<br>
No aim is there, only a will to be.<br>
All walk by Nature bound for ever the same.<br>
Look on these forms that stay awhile and pass,<br>
These lives that long and strive, then are no more,<br>
These structures that have no abiding truth,<br>
The saviour creeds that cannot save themselves,<br>
But perish in the strangling hands of the years,<br>
Discarded from man’s thought, proved false by Time,<br>

But learn not what they are or why they came;<br>
These polities, architectures of man’s brain,<br>
That, bricked with evil and good, wall in man’s spirit<br>
And, fissured houses, palace at once and jail,<br>
Rot while they reign and crumble before they crash;<br>
These revolutions, demon or drunken god,<br>
Convulsing the wounded body of mankind<br>
Only to paint in new colours an old face;<br>
These wars, carnage triumphant, ruin gone mad,<br>
The work of centuries vanishing in an hour,<br>
The blood of the vanquished and the victor’s crown<br>
Which men to be born must pay for with their pain,<br>
The hero’s face divine on satyr’s limbs,<br>
The demon’s grandeur mixed with the demigod’s,<br>
The glory and the beasthood and the shame;<br>
Why is it all, the labour and the din,<br>
The transient joys, the timeless sea of tears,<br>
The longing and the hoping and the cry,<br>
The battle and the victory and the fall,<br>
The aimless journey that can never pause,<br>
The waking toil, the incoherent sleep,<br>
Song, shouts and weeping, wisdom and idle words,<br>
The laughter of men, the irony of the gods?<br>
Where leads the march, whither the pilgrimage?<br>
Who keeps the map of the route or planned each stage?<br>
Or else self-moved the world walks its own way,<br>
Or nothing is there but only a Mind that dreams:<br>
The world is a myth that happened to come true,<br>
A legend told to itself by conscious Mind,<br>
Imaged and played on a feigned Matter’s ground<br>
On which it stands in an unsubstantial Vast.<br>
Mind is the author, spectator, actor, stage:<br>
Mind only is and what it thinks is seen.<br>
If Mind is all, renounce the hope of bliss;<br>
If Mind is all, renounce the hope of Truth.<br>
For Mind can never touch the body of Truth<br>

<br>
And Mind can never see the soul of God;<br>
Only his shadow it grasps nor hears his laugh<br>
As it turns from him to the vain seeming of things.<br>
Mind is a tissue woven of light and shade<br>
Where right and wrong have sewn their mingled parts;<br>
Or Mind is Nature’s marriage of convenance<br>
Between truth and falsehood, between joy and pain:<br>
This struggling pair no court can separate.<br>
Each thought is a gold coin with bright alloy<br>
And error and truth are its obverse and reverse:<br>
This is the imperial mintage of the brain<br>
And of this kind is all its currency.<br>
Think not to plant on earth the living Truth<br>
Or make of Matter’s world the home of God;<br>
Truth comes not there but only the thought of Truth,<br>
God is not there but only the name of God.<br>
If Self there is it is bodiless and unborn;<br>
It is no one and it is possessed by none.<br>
On what shalt thou then build thy happy world?<br>
Cast off thy life and mind, then art thou Self,<br>
An all-seeing omnipresence stark, alone.<br>
If God there is he cares not for the world;<br>
All things he sees with calm indifferent gaze,<br>
He has doomed all hearts to sorrow and desire,<br>
He has bound all life with his implacable laws;<br>
He answers not the ignorant voice of prayer.<br>
Eternal while the ages toil beneath,<br>
Unmoved, untouched by aught that he has made,<br>
He sees as minute details mid the stars<br>
The animal’s agony and the fate of man:<br>
Immeasurably wise, he exceeds thy thought;<br>
His solitary joy needs not thy love.<br>
His truth in human thinking cannot dwell:<br>
If thou desirest Truth, then still thy mind<br>
For ever, slain by the dumb unseen Light.<br>
Immortal bliss lives not in human air:<br>

How shall the mighty Mother her calm delight<br>
Keep fragrant in this narrow fragile vase,<br>
Or lodge her sweet unbroken ecstasy<br>
In hearts which earthly sorrow can assail<br>
And bodies careless Death can slay at will?<br>
Dream not to change the world that God has planned,<br>
Strive not to alter his eternal law.<br>
If heavens there are whose gates are shut to grief,<br>
There seek the joy thou couldst not find on earth;<br>
Or in the imperishable hemisphere<br>
Where Light is native and Delight is king<br>
And Spirit is the deathless ground of things,<br>
Choose thy high station, child of Eternity.<br>
If thou art Spirit and Nature is thy robe,<br>
Cast off thy garb and be thy naked self<br>
Immutable in its undying truth,<br>
Alone for ever in the mute Alone.<br>
Turn then to God, for him leave all behind;<br>
Forgetting love, forgetting Satyavan,<br>
Annul thyself in his immobile peace.<br>
O soul, drown in his still beatitude.<br>
For thou must die to thyself to reach God’s height:<br>
I, Death, am the gate of immortality.”<br>
But Savitri answered to the sophist God:<br>
“Once more wilt thou call Light to blind Truth’s eyes,<br>
Make Knowledge a catch of the snare of Ignorance<br>
And the Word a dart to slay my living soul?<br>
Offer, O King, thy boons to tired spirits<br>
And hearts that could not bear the wounds of Time,<br>
Let those who were tied to body and to mind,<br>
Tear off those bonds and flee into white calm<br>
Crying for a refuge from the play of God.<br>
Surely thy boons are great since thou art He!<br>
But how shall I seek rest in endless peace<br>
Who house the mighty Mother’s violent force,<br>
Her vision turned to read the enigmaed world,<br>

Her will tempered in the blaze of Wisdom’s sun<br>
And the flaming silence of her heart of love?<br>
The world is a spiritual paradox<br>
Invented by a need in the Unseen,<br>
A poor translation to the creature’s sense<br>
Of That which for ever exceeds idea and speech,<br>
A symbol of what can never be symbolised,<br>
A language mispronounced, misspelt, yet true.<br>
Its powers have come from the eternal heights<br>
And plunged into the inconscient dim Abyss<br>
And risen from it to do their marvellous work.<br>
The soul is a figure of the Unmanifest,<br>
The mind labours to think the Unthinkable,<br>
The life to call the Immortal into birth,<br>
The body to enshrine the Illimitable.<br>
The world is not cut off from Truth and God.<br>
In vain thou hast dug the dark unbridgeable gulf,<br>
In vain thou hast built the blind and doorless wall:<br>
Man’s soul crosses through thee to Paradise,<br>
Heaven’s sun forces its way through death and night;<br>
Its light is seen upon our being’s verge.<br>
My mind is a torch lit from the eternal sun,<br>
My life a breath drawn by the immortal Guest,<br>
My mortal body is the Eternal’s house.<br>
Already the torch becomes the undying ray,<br>
Already the life is the Immortal’s force,<br>
The house grows of the householder part and one.<br>
How sayst thou Truth can never light the human mind<br>
And Bliss can never invade the mortal’s heart<br>
Or God descend into the world he made?<br>
If in the meaningless Void creation rose,<br>
If from a bodiless Force Matter was born,<br>
If Life could climb in the unconscious tree,<br>
Its green delight break into emerald leaves<br>
And its laughter of beauty blossom in the flower,<br>
If sense could wake in tissue, nerve and cell<br>

And Thought seize the grey matter of the brain,<br>
And soul peep from its secrecy through the flesh,<br>
How shall the nameless Light not leap on men,<br>
And unknown powers emerge from Nature’s sleep?<br>
Even now hints of a luminous Truth like stars<br>
Arise in the mind-mooned splendour of Ignorance;<br>
Even now the deathless Lover’s touch we feel:<br>
If the chamber’s door is even a little ajar,<br>
What then can hinder God from stealing in<br>
Or who forbid his kiss on the sleeping soul?<br>
Already God is near, the Truth is close:<br>
Because the dark atheist body knows him not,<br>
Must the sage deny the Light, the seer his soul?<br>
I am not bound by thought or sense or shape;<br>
I live in the glory of the Infinite,<br>
I am near to the Nameless and Unknowable,<br>
The Ineffable is now my household mate.<br>
But standing on Eternity’s luminous brink<br>
I have discovered that the world was He;<br>
I have met Spirit with spirit, Self with self,<br>
But I have loved too the body of my God.<br>
I have pursued him in his earthly form.<br>
A lonely freedom cannot satisfy<br>
A heart that has grown one with every heart:<br>
I am a deputy of the aspiring world,<br>
My spirit’s liberty I ask for all.”<br>
Then rang again a deeper cry of Death.<br>
As if beneath its weight of sterile law<br>
Oppressed by its own obstinate meaningless will,<br>
Disdainful, weary and compassionate,<br>
It kept no more its old intolerant sound,<br>
But seemed like life’s in her unnumbered paths<br>
Toiling for ever and achieving nought<br>
Because of birth and change, her mortal powers<br>
By which she lasts, around the term-posts fixed<br>

Turning of a wide circling aimless race<br>
Whose course for ever speeds and is the same.<br>
In its long play with Fate and Chance and Time<br>
Assured of the game’s vanity lost or won,<br>
Crushed by its load of ignorance and doubt<br>
Which knowledge seems to increase and growth to enlarge,<br>
The earth-mind sinks and it despairs and looks<br>
Old, weary and discouraged on its work.<br>
Yet was all nothing then or vainly achieved?<br>
Some great thing has been done, some light, some power<br>
Delivered from the huge Inconscient’s grasp:<br>
It has emerged from night; it sees its dawns<br>
Circling for ever though no dawn can stay.<br>
This change was in the godhead’s far-flung voice;<br>
His form of dread was altered and admitted<br>
Our transient effort at eternity,<br>
Yet flung vast doubts of what might else have been<br>
On grandiose hints of an impossible day.<br>
The great voice surging cried to Savitri:<br>
“Because thou knowst the wisdom that transcends<br>
Both veil of forms and the contempt of forms,<br>
Arise delivered by the seeing gods.<br>
If free thou hadst kept thy mind from life’s fierce stress,<br>
Thou mightst have been like them omniscient, calm.<br>
But the violent and passionate heart forbids.<br>
It is the storm bird of an anarch Power<br>
That would upheave the world and tear from it<br>
The indecipherable scroll of Fate,<br>
Death’s rule and Law and the unknowable Will.<br>
Hasteners to action, violators of God<br>
Are these great spirits who have too much love,<br>
And they who formed like thee, for both art thou,<br>
Have come into the narrow bounds of life<br>
With too large natures overleaping time.<br>
Worshippers of force who know not her recoil,<br>
Their giant wills compel the troubled years.<br>

The wise are tranquil; silent the great hills<br>
Rise ceaselessly towards their unreached sky,<br>
Seated on their unchanging base, their heads<br>
Dreamless in heaven’s immutable domain.<br>
On their aspiring tops, sublime and still,<br>
Lifting half-way to heaven the climbing soul<br>
The mighty mediators stand content<br>
To watch the revolutions of the stars:<br>
Motionlessly moving with the might of earth,<br>
They see the ages pass and are the same.<br>
The wise think with the cycles, they hear the tread<br>
Of far-off things; patient, unmoved they keep<br>
Their dangerous wisdom in their depths restrained,<br>
Lest man’s frail days into the unknown should sink<br>
Dragged like a ship by bound leviathan<br>
Into the abyss of his stupendous seas.<br>
Lo, how all shakes when the gods tread too near!<br>
All moves, is in peril, anguished, torn, upheaved.<br>
The hurrying aeons would stumble on too swift<br>
If strength from heaven surprised the imperfect earth<br>
And veilless knowledge smote these unfit souls.<br>
The deities have screened their dreadful power:<br>
God hides his thought and, even, he seems to err.<br>
Be still and tardy in the slow wise world.<br>
Mighty art thou with the dread goddess filled,<br>
To whom thou criedst at dawn in the dim woods.<br>
Use not thy strength like the wild Titan souls!<br>
Touch not the seated lines, the ancient laws,<br>
Respect the calm of great established things.”<br>
But Savitri replied to the huge god:<br>
“What is the calm thou vauntst, O Law, O Death?<br>
Is it not the dull-visioned tread inert<br>
Of monstrous energies chained in a stark round<br>
Soulless and stone-eyed with mechanic dreams?<br>
Vain the soul’s hope if changeless Law is all:<br>

What were earth’s ages if the grey restraint<br>
Were never broken and glories sprang not forth<br>
Bursting their obscure seed, while man’s slow life<br>
Leaped hurried into sudden splendid paths<br>
By divine words and human gods revealed?<br>
Impose not upon sentient minds and hearts<br>
The dull fixity that binds inanimate things.<br>
Well is the unconscious rule for the animal breeds<br>
Content to live beneath the immutable yoke;<br>
Man turns to a nobler walk, a master path.<br>
I trample on thy law with living feet;<br>
For to arise in freedom I was born.<br>
If I am mighty let my force be unveiled<br>
Equal companion of the dateless powers,<br>
Or else let my frustrated soul sink down<br>
Unworthy of Godhead in the original sleep.<br>
I claim from Time my will’s eternity,<br>
God from his moments.” Death replied to her,<br>
“Why should the noble and immortal will<br>
Stoop to the petty works of transient earth,<br>
Freedom forgotten and the Eternal’s path?<br>
Or is this the high use of strength and thought,<br>
To struggle with the bonds of death and time<br>
And spend the labour that might earn the gods<br>
And battle and bear agony of wounds<br>
To grasp the trivial joys that earth can guard<br>
In her small treasure-chest of passing things?<br>
Child, hast thou trodden the gods beneath thy feet<br>
Only to win poor shreds of earthly life<br>
For him thou lov’st cancelling the grand release,<br>
Keeping from early rapture of the heavens<br>
His soul the lenient deities have called?<br>
Are thy arms sweeter than the courts of God?”<br>
She answered, “Straight I trample on the road<br>

I run where his sweet dreadful voice commands<br>
And I am driven by the reins of God.<br>
Why drew he wide his scheme of mighty worlds<br>
Or filled infinity with his passionate breath?<br>
Or wherefore did he build my mortal form<br>
And sow in me his bright and proud desires,<br>
If not to achieve, to flower in me, to love,<br>
Carving his human image richly shaped<br>
In thoughts and largenesses and golden powers?<br>
Far Heaven can wait our coming in its calm.<br>

Earth was his difficult matter, earth the glory<br>
Gave of the problem and the race and strife.<br>
There are the ominous masks, the terrible powers;<br>
There it is greatness to create the gods.<br>
Is not the spirit immortal and absolved<br>
Always, delivered from the grasp of Time?<br>
Why came it down into the mortal’s Space?<br>
A charge he gave to his high spirit in man<br>
And wrote a hidden decree on Nature’s tops.<br>
Freedom is this with ever seated soul,<br>
Large in life’s limits, strong in Matter’s knots,<br>
Building great stuff of action from the worlds<br>
To make fine wisdom from coarse, scattered strands<br>
And love and beauty out of war and night,<br>
The wager wonderful, the game divine.<br>
What liberty has the soul which feels not free<br>
Unless stripped bare and cannot kiss the bonds<br>
The Lover winds around his playmate’s limbs,<br>
Choosing his tyranny, crushed in his embrace?<br>
To seize him better with her boundless heart<br>
She accepts the limiting circle of his arms,<br>
Bows full of bliss beneath his mastering hands<br>
And laughs in his rich constraints, most bound, most free.<br>
This is my answer to thy lures, O Death.”<br>

Immutable, Death’s denial met her cry:<br>
“However mighty, whatever thy secret name<br>
Uttered in hidden conclaves of the gods,<br>
Thy heart’s ephemeral passion cannot break<br>
The iron rampart of accomplished things<br>
With which the great Gods fence their camp in Space.<br>
Whoever thou art behind thy human mask,<br>
Even if thou art the Mother of the worlds<br>
And pegst thy claim upon the realms of Chance,<br>
The cosmic Law is greater than thy will.<br>
Even God himself obeys the Laws he made:<br>

Vaunting a Force behind on which it leans,<br>
A Light above which none but thou hast seen,<br>

But what is Truth and who can find her form<br>
Amid the specious images of sense,<br>
Amid the crowding guesses of the mind<br>
And the dark ambiguities of a world<br>
Peopled with the incertitudes of Thought?<br>
For where is Truth and when was her footfall heard<br>
Amid the endless clamour of Time’s mart<br>
And which is her voice amid the thousand cries<br>
That cross the listening brain and cheat the soul?<br>
Or is Truth aught but a high starry name<br>
Or a vague and splendid word by which man’s thought<br>
Sanctions and consecrates his nature’s choice,<br>
The heart’s wish donning knowledge as its robe,<br>
The cherished idea elect among the elect,<br>

A cosmic Thought spreads out its vastitudes;<br>
Its smallest parts are here philosophies<br>
Challenging with their detailed immensity,<br>
Each figuring an omniscient scheme of things.<br>
But higher still can climb the ascending light;<br>
There are vasts of vision and eternal suns,<br>

Oceans of an immortal luminousness,<br>
Flame-hills assaulting heaven with their peaks,<br>
There dwelling all becomes a blaze of sight;<br>
A burning head of vision leads the mind,<br>
Thought trails behind it its long comet tail;<br>
The heart glows, an illuminate and seer,<br>
And sense is kindled into identity.<br>
A highest flight climbs to a deepest view:<br>
In a wide opening of its native sky<br>
Intuition’s lightnings range in a bright pack<br>
Hunting all hidden truths out of their lairs,<br>
Its fiery edge of seeing absolute<br>
Cleaves into locked unknown retreats of self,<br>
Rummages the sky-recesses of the brain,<br>
Lights up the occult chambers of the heart;<br>
Its spear-point ictus of discovery<br>
Pressed on the cover of name, the screen of form,<br>
Strips bare the secret soul of all that is.<br>
Thought there has revelation’s sun-bright eyes;<br>
The Word, a mighty and inspiring Voice,<br>
Enters Truth’s inmost cabin of privacy<br>
And tears away the veil from God and life.<br>
Then stretches the boundless finite’s last expanse,<br>
The cosmic empire of the Overmind,<br>
Time’s buffer state bordering Eternity,<br>
Too vast for the experience of man’s soul:<br>
All here gathers beneath one golden sky:<br>
The Powers that build the cosmos station take<br>
In its house of infinite possibility;<br>
Each god from there builds his own nature’s world;<br>
Ideas are phalanxed like a group of suns,<br>
Each marshalling his company of rays.<br>
Thought crowds in masses seized by one regard;<br>
All Time is one body, Space a single look:<br>
There is the Godhead’s universal gaze<br>
And there the boundaries of immortal Mind:<br>

<br>
The line that parts and joins the hemispheres<br>
Closes in on the labour of the Gods<br>
Fencing eternity from the toil of Time.<br>
In her glorious kingdom of eternal light<br>
All-ruler, ruled by none, the Truth supreme,<br>
Omnipotent, omniscient and alone,<br>
In a golden country keeps her measureless house;<br>
In its corridor she hears the tread that comes<br>
Out of the Unmanifest never to return<br>
Till the Unknown is known and seen by men.<br>
Above the stretch and blaze of cosmic Sight,<br>
Above the silence of the wordless Thought,<br>
Formless creator of immortal forms,<br>
Nameless, investitured with the name divine,<br>
Transcending Time’s hours, transcending Timelessness,<br>
The Mighty Mother sits in lucent calm<br>
And holds the eternal Child upon her knees<br>
Attending the day when he shall speak to Fate.<br>
There is the image of our future’s hope;<br>
There is the sun for which all darkness waits,<br>
There is the imperishable harmony;<br>
The world’s contradictions climb to her and are one:<br>
There is the Truth of which the world’s truths are shreds,<br>
The Light of which the world’s ignorance is the shade<br>
Till Truth draws back the shade that it has cast,<br>
The Love our hearts call down to heal all strife,<br>
The Bliss for which the world’s derelict sorrows yearn:<br>
Thence comes the glory sometimes seen on earth,<br>
The visits of Godhead to the human soul,<br>
The Beauty and the dream on Nature’s face.<br>
There the perfection born from eternity<br>
Calls to it the perfection born in Time,<br>
The truth of God surprising human life,<br>
The image of God overtaking finite shapes.<br>
There in a world of everlasting Light,<br>
In the realms of the immortal Supermind<br>

Truth who hides here her head in mystery,<br>
Her riddle deemed by reason impossible<br>
In the stark structure of material form,<br>
Unenigmaed lives, unmasked her face and there<br>
Is Nature and the common law of things.<br>
There in a body made of spirit stuff,<br>
The hearth-stone of the everliving Fire,<br>
Action translates the movements of the soul,<br>
Thought steps infallible and absolute<br>
And life is a continual worship’s rite,<br>
A sacrifice of rapture to the One.<br>
A cosmic vision, a spiritual sense<br>
Feels all the Infinite lodged in finite form<br>
And seen through a quivering ecstasy of light<br>
Discovers the bright face of the Bodiless,<br>
In the truth of a moment, in the moment’s soul<br>
Can sip the honey-wine of Eternity.<br>
A Spirit who is no one and innumerable,<br>
The one mystic infinite Person of his world<br>
Multiplies his myriad personality,<br>
On all his bodies seals his divinity’s stamp<br>
And sits in each immortal and unique.<br>
The Immobile stands behind each daily act,<br>
A background of the movement and the scene,<br>
Upholding creation on its might and calm<br>
And change on the Immutable’s deathless poise.<br>
The Timeless looks out from the travelling hours;<br>
The Ineffable puts on a robe of speech<br>
Where all its words are woven like magic threads<br>
Moving with beauty, inspiring with their gleam,<br>
And every thought takes up its destined place<br>
Recorded in the memory of the world.<br>
The Truth supreme, vast and impersonal<br>
Fits faultlessly the hour and circumstance,<br>
Its substance a pure gold ever the same<br>
But shaped into vessels for the spirit’s use,<br>
<br>
662<br>
<br>
CANTO IV: The Dream Twilight of the Earthly Real<br>
<br>
Its gold becomes the wine jar and the vase.<br>
All there is a supreme epiphany:<br>
The All-Wonderful makes a marvel of each event,<br>
The All-Beautiful is a miracle in each shape;<br>
The All-Blissful smites with rapture the heart’s throbs,<br>
A pure celestial joy is the use of sense.<br>
Each being there is a member of the Self,<br>
A portion of the million-thoughted All,<br>
A claimant to the timeless Unity,<br>
The many’s sweetness, the joy of difference<br>
Edged with the intimacy of the One.<br>
“But who can show to thee Truth’s glorious face?<br>
Our human words can only shadow her.<br>
To thought she is an unthinkable rapture of light,<br>
To speech a marvel inexpressible.<br>
O Death, if thou couldst touch the Truth supreme<br>
Thou wouldst grow suddenly wise and cease to be.<br>
If our souls could see and love and clasp God’s Truth,<br>
Its infinite radiance would seize our hearts,<br>
Our being in God’s image be remade<br>
And earthly life become the life divine.”<br>
Then Death the last time answered Savitri:<br>
“If Truth supreme transcends her shadow here<br>
Severed by Knowledge and the climbing vasts,<br>
What bridge can cross the gulf that she has left<br>
Between her and the dream-world she has made?<br>
Or who could hope to bring her down to men<br>
And persuade to tread the harsh globe with wounded feet<br>
Leaving her unapproachable glory and bliss,<br>
Wasting her splendour on pale earthly air?<br>
Is thine that strength, O beauty of mortal limbs,<br>
O soul who flutterest to escape my net?<br>
Who then art thou hiding in human guise?<br>
Thy voice carries the sound of infinity,<br>
Knowledge is with thee, Truth speaks through thy words;<br>
The light of things beyond shines in thy eyes.<br>
<br>
663<br>
<br>
BOOK X: The Book of the Double Twilight<br>
<br>
But where is thy strength to conquer Time and Death?<br>
Hast thou God’s force to build heaven’s values here?<br>
For truth and knowledge are an idle gleam<br>
If Knowledge brings not power to change the world,<br>
If Might comes not to give to Truth her right.<br>
A blind Force, not Truth has made this ignorant world,<br>
A blind Force, not Truth orders the lives of men:<br>
By Power, not Light, the great Gods rule the world;<br>
Power is the arm of God, the seal of Fate.<br>
O human claimant to immortality,<br>
Reveal thy power, lay bare thy spirit’s force,<br>
Then will I give back to thee Satyavan.<br>
Or if the Mighty Mother is with thee,<br>
Show me her face that I may worship her;<br>
Let deathless eyes look into the eyes of Death,<br>
An imperishable Force touching brute things<br>
Transform earth’s death into immortal life.<br>
Then can thy dead return to thee and live.<br>
The prostrate earth perhaps shall lift her gaze<br>
And feel near her the secret body of God<br>
And love and joy overtake fleeing Time.”<br>
And Savitri looked on Death and answered not.<br>
Almost it seemed as if in his symbol shape<br>
The world’s darkness had consented to Heaven-light<br>
And God needed no more the Inconscient’s screen.<br>
A mighty transformation came on her.<br>
A halo of the indwelling Deity,<br>
The Immortal’s lustre that had lit her face<br>
And tented its radiance in her body’s house,<br>
Overflowing made the air a luminous sea.<br>
In a flaming moment of apocalypse<br>
The Incarnation thrust aside its veil.<br>
A little figure in infinity<br>
Yet stood and seemed the Eternal’s very house,<br>
As if the world’s centre was her very soul<br>
<br>
664<br>

And all wide space was but its outer robe.<br>
A curve of the calm hauteur of far heaven<br>
Descending into earth’s humility,<br>
Her forehead’s span vaulted the Omniscient’s gaze,<br>
Her eyes were two stars that watched the universe.<br>
The Power that from her being’s summit reigned,<br>
The Presence chambered in lotus secrecy,<br>
Came down and held the centre in her brow<br>
Where the mind’s Lord in his control-room sits;<br>
There throned on concentration’s native seat<br>
He opens that third mysterious eye in man,<br>
The Unseen’s eye that looks at the unseen,<br>
When Light with a golden ecstasy fills his brain<br>
And the Eternal’s wisdom drives his choice<br>
And eternal Will seizes the mortal’s will.<br>
It stirred in the lotus of her throat of song,<br>
And in her speech throbbed the immortal Word,<br>
Her life sounded with the steps of the world-soul<br>
Moving in harmony with the cosmic Thought.<br>
As glides God’s sun into the mystic cave<br>
Where hides his light from the pursuing gods,<br>
It glided into the lotus of her heart<br>
And woke in it the Force that alters Fate.<br>
It poured into her navel’s lotus depth,<br>
Lodged in the little life-nature’s narrow home,<br>
On the body’s longings grew heaven-rapture’s flower<br>
And made desire a pure celestial flame,<br>
Broke into the cave where coiled World-Energy sleeps<br>
And smote the thousand-hooded serpent Force<br>
That blazing towered and clasped the World-Self above,<br>
Joined Matter’s dumbness to the Spirit’s hush<br>
And filled earth’s acts with the Spirit’s silent power.<br>
Thus changed she waited for the Word to speak.<br>
Eternity looked into the eyes of Death<br>
And Darkness saw God’s living Reality.<br>
Then a Voice was heard that seemed the stillness’ self<br>

<br>
Or the low calm utterance of infinity<br>
When it speaks to the silence in the heart of sleep.<br>
“I hail thee, almighty and victorious Death,<br>
Thou grandiose Darkness of the Infinite.<br>
O Void that makest room for all to be,<br>
Hunger that gnawest at the universe<br>
Consuming the cold remnants of the suns<br>
And eatst the whole world with thy jaws of fire,<br>
Waster of the energy that has made the stars,<br>
Inconscience, carrier of the seeds of thought,<br>
Nescience in which All-Knowledge sleeps entombed<br>
And slowly emerges in its hollow breast<br>
Wearing the mind’s mask of bright Ignorance.<br>
Thou art my shadow and my instrument.<br>
I have given thee thy awful shape of dread<br>
And thy sharp sword of terror and grief and pain<br>
To force the soul of man to struggle for light<br>
On the brevity of his half-conscious days.<br>
Thou art his spur to greatness in his works,<br>
The whip to his yearning for eternal bliss,<br>
His poignant need of immortality.<br>
Live, Death, awhile, be still my instrument.<br>
One day man too shall know thy fathomless heart<br>
Of silence and the brooding peace of Night<br>
And grave obedience to eternal Law<br>
And the calm inflexible pity in thy gaze.<br>
But now, O timeless Mightiness, stand aside<br>
And leave the path of my incarnate Force.<br>
Relieve the radiant God from thy black mask:<br>
Release the soul of the world called Satyavan<br>
Freed from thy clutch of pain and ignorance<br>
That he may stand master of life and fate,<br>
Man’s representative in the house of God,<br>
The mate of Wisdom and the spouse of Light,<br>
The eternal bridegroom of the eternal bride.”<br>
She spoke; Death unconvinced resisted still,<br>

Although he knew refusing still to know,<br>
Although he saw refusing still to see.<br>
Unshakable he stood claiming his right.<br>
His spirit bowed; his will obeyed the law<br>
Of its own nature binding even on Gods.<br>
The Two opposed each other face to face.<br>
His being like a huge fort of darkness towered;<br>
Around it her light grew, an ocean’s siege.<br>
Awhile the Shade survived defying heaven:<br>
Assailing in front, oppressing from above,<br>
A concrete mass of conscious power, he bore<br>
The tyranny of her divine desire.<br>
A pressure of intolerable force<br>
Weighed on his unbowed head and stubborn breast;<br>
Light like a burning tongue licked up his thoughts,<br>
Light was a luminous torture in his heart,<br>
Light coursed, a splendid agony, through his nerves;<br>
His darkness muttered perishing in her blaze.<br>
Her mastering Word commanded every limb<br>
And left no room for his enormous will<br>
That seemed pushed out into some helpless space<br>
And could no more re-enter but left him void.<br>
He called to Night but she fell shuddering back,<br>
He called to Hell but sullenly it retired:<br>
He turned to the Inconscient for support,<br>
From which he was born, his vast sustaining self;<br>
It drew him back towards boundless vacancy<br>
As if by himself to swallow up himself:<br>
He called to his strength, but it refused his call.<br>
His body was eaten by light, his spirit devoured.<br>
At last he knew defeat inevitable<br>
And left crumbling the shape that he had worn,<br>
Abandoning hope to make man’s soul his prey<br>
And force to be mortal the immortal spirit.<br>
Afar he fled shunning her dreaded touch<br>
And refuge took in the retreating Night.<br>

The dire universal Shadow disappeared<br>
Vanishing into the Void from which it came.<br>
As if deprived of its original cause,<br>
The twilight realm passed fading from their souls,<br>
And Satyavan and Savitri were alone.<br>
But neither stirred: between those figures rose<br>
A mute invisible and translucent wall.<br>
In the long blank moment’s pause nothing could move:<br>
All waited on the unknown inscrutable Will.<br>

A MARVELLOUS sun looked down from ecstasy’s skies<br>
On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection’s home,<br>
Magical unfoldings of the Eternal’s smile<br>
Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight.<br>
God’s everlasting day surrounded her,<br>
Domains appeared of sempiternal light<br>
Invading all Nature with the Absolute’s joy.<br>
Her body quivered with eternity’s touch,<br>
Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite.<br>
Infinity’s finite fronts she lived in, new<br>
For ever to an everliving sight.<br>
Eternity multiplied its vast self-look<br>
Translating its endless mightiness and joy<br>
Into delight souls playing with Time could share<br>
In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths,<br>
In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights,<br>
In passionate heart-beats of an undying love,<br>
In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade.<br>
Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes,<br>
In serene arches of translucent calm<br>
From Wonder’s dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down<br>
An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes<br>
Which suffered without pain the absolute ray<br>
And saw immortal clarities of form.<br>
Twilight and mist were exiles from that air,<br>
Night was impossible to such radiant heavens.<br>
Firm in the bosom of immensity<br>
Spiritual breadths were seen, sublimely born<br>
From a still beauty of creative joy;<br>
Embodied thoughts to sweet dimensions held<br>
<br>
BOOK XI: The Book of Everlasting Day<br>

To please some carelessness of divine peace,<br>
Answered the deep demand of an infinite sense<br>
And its need of forms to house its bodiless thrill.<br>
A march of universal powers in Time,<br>
The harmonic order of self’s vastitudes<br>
In cyclic symmetries and metric planes<br>
Harboured a cosmic rapture’s revelry,<br>
An endless figuring of the spirit in things<br>
Planned by the artist who has dreamed the worlds;<br>
Of all the beauty and the marvel here,<br>
Of all Time’s intricate variety<br>
Eternity was the substance and the source;<br>
Not from a plastic mist of Matter made,<br>
They offered the suggestion of their depths<br>
And opened the great series of their powers.<br>
Arisen beneath a triple mystic heaven<br>
The seven immortal earths were seen, sublime:<br>
Homes of the blest released from death and sleep<br>
Where grief can never come nor any pang<br>
Arriving from self-lost and seeking worlds<br>
Alter Heaven-nature’s changeless quietude<br>
And mighty posture of eternal calm,<br>
Its pose of ecstasy immutable.<br>
Plains lay that seemed the expanse of God’s wide sleep,<br>
Thought’s wings climbed up towards heaven’s vast repose<br>
Lost in blue deeps of immortality.<br>
A changed earth-nature felt the breath of peace.<br>
Air seemed an ocean of felicity<br>
Or the couch of the unknown spiritual rest,<br>
A vast quiescence swallowing up all sound<br>
Into a voicelessness of utter bliss;<br>
Even Matter brought a close spiritual touch,<br>
All thrilled with the immanence of one divine.<br>
The lowest of these earths was still a heaven<br>
Translating into the splendour of things divine<br>
The beauty and brightness of terrestrial scenes.<br>

Eternal mountains ridge on gleaming ridge<br>
Whose lines were graved as on a sapphire plate<br>
And etched the borders of heaven’s lustrous noon<br>
Climbed like piled temple stairs and from their heads<br>
Of topless meditation heard below<br>
The approach of a blue pilgrim multitude<br>
And listened to a great arriving voice<br>
Of the wide travel hymn of timeless seas.<br>
A chanting crowd from mountain bosoms slipped<br>
Past branches fragrant with a sigh of flowers<br>
Hurrying through sweetnesses with revel leaps;<br>
The murmurous rivers of felicity<br>
Divinely rippled honey-voiced desires,<br>
Mingling their sister eddies of delight,<br>
Then, widening to a pace of calm-lipped muse,<br>
Down many-glimmered estuaries of dream<br>
Went whispering into lakes of liquid peace.<br>
On a brink held of senseless ecstasy<br>
And guarding an eternal poise of thought<br>
Sat sculptured souls dreaming by rivers of sound<br>
In changeless attitudes of marble bliss.<br>
Around her lived the children of God’s day<br>
In an unspeakable felicity,<br>
A happiness never lost, the immortal’s ease,<br>
A glad eternity’s blissful multitude.<br>
Around, the deathless nations moved and spoke,<br>
Souls of a luminous celestial joy,<br>
Faces of stark beauty, limbs of the moulded Ray;<br>
In cities cut like gems of conscious stone<br>
And wonderful pastures and on gleaming coasts<br>
Bright forms were seen, eternity’s luminous tribes.<br>
Above her rhythming godheads whirled the spheres,<br>
Rapt mobile fixities here blindly sought<br>
By the huge erring orbits of our stars.<br>
Ecstatic voices smote at hearing’s chords,<br>
Each movement found a music all its own;<br>

Songs thrilled of birds upon unfading boughs<br>
The colours of whose plumage had been caught<br>
From the rainbow of imagination’s wings.<br>
Immortal fragrance packed the quivering breeze.<br>
In groves that seemed moved bosoms and trembling depths<br>
The million children of the undying spring<br>
Bloomed, pure unnumbered stars of hued delight<br>
Nestling for shelter in their emerald sky:<br>
Faery flower-masses looked with laughing eyes.<br>
A dancing chaos, an iridescent sea<br>
Eternised to Heaven’s ever-wakeful sight<br>
The crowding petal-glow of marvel’s tints<br>
Which float across the curtained lids of dream.<br>
Immortal harmonies filled her listening ear;<br>
A great spontaneous utterance of the heights<br>
On Titan wings of rhythmic grandeur borne<br>
Poured from some deep spiritual heart of sound,<br>
Strains trembling with the secrets of the gods.<br>
A spirit wandered happily in the wind,<br>
A spirit brooded in the leaf and stone;<br>
The voices of thought-conscious instruments<br>
Along a living verge of silence strayed,<br>
And from some deep, a wordless tongue of things<br>
Unfathomed, inexpressible, chantings rose<br>
Translating into a voice the Unknown.<br>
A climber on the invisible stair of sound,<br>
Music not with these few and striving steps<br>
Aspired that wander upon transient strings,<br>
But changed its ever new uncounted notes<br>
In a passion of unforeseeing discovery,<br>
And kept its old unforgotten ecstasies<br>
A growing treasure in the mystic heart.<br>
A consciousness that yearned through every cry<br>
Of unexplored attraction and desire,<br>
It found and searched again the unsatisfied deeps<br>
Hunting as if in some deep secret heart<br>

<br>
To find some lost or missed felicity.<br>
In those far-lapsing symphonies she could hear,<br>
Breaking through enchantments of the ravished sense,<br>
The lyric voyage of a divine soul<br>
Mid spume and laughter tempting with its prow<br>
The charm of innocent Circean isles,<br>
Adventures without danger beautiful<br>
In lands where siren Wonder sings its lures<br>
From rhythmic rocks in ever-foaming seas.<br>
In the harmony of an original sight<br>
Delivered from our limiting ray of thought,<br>
And the reluctance of our blinded hearts<br>
To embrace the Godhead in whatever guise,<br>
She saw all Nature marvellous without fault.<br>
Invaded by beauty’s universal revel<br>
Her being’s fibre reached out vibrating<br>
And claimed deep union with its outer selves,<br>
And on the heart’s chords made pure to seize all tones<br>
Heaven’s subtleties of touch unwearying forced<br>
More vivid raptures than earth’s life can bear.<br>
What would be suffering here, was fiery bliss.<br>
All here but passionate hint and mystic shade<br>
Divined by the inner prophet who perceives<br>
The spirit of delight in sensuous things,<br>
Turned to more sweetness than can now be dreamed.<br>
The mighty signs of which earth fears the stress,<br>
Trembling because she cannot understand,<br>
And must keep obscure in forms strange and sublime,<br>
Were here the first lexicon of an infinite mind<br>
Translating the language of eternal bliss.<br>
Here rapture was a common incident;<br>
The lovelinesses of whose captured thrill<br>
Our human pleasure is a fallen thread,<br>
Lay, symbol shapes, a careless ornament,<br>
Sewn on the rich brocade of Godhead’s dress.<br>
Things fashioned were the imaged homes where mind<br>

Arrived to fathom a deep physical joy;<br>
The heart was a torch lit from infinity,<br>
The limbs were trembling densities of soul.<br>
These were the first domains, the outer courts<br>
Immense but least in range and least in price,<br>
The slightest ecstasies of the undying gods.<br>
Higher her swing of vision swept and knew,<br>
Admitted through large sapphire opening gates<br>
Into the wideness of a light beyond,<br>
These were but sumptuous decorated doors<br>
To worlds nobler, more felicitously fair.<br>
Endless aspired the climbing of those heavens;<br>
Realm upon realm received her soaring view.<br>
Then on what seemed one crown of the ascent<br>
Where finite and the infinite are one,<br>
Immune she beheld the strong immortals’ seats<br>
Who live for a celestial joy and rule,<br>
The middle regions of the unfading Ray.<br>
Great forms of deities sat in deathless tiers,<br>
Eyes of an unborn gaze towards her leaned<br>
Through a transparency of crystal fire.<br>
In the beauty of bodies wrought from rapture’s lines,<br>
Shapes of entrancing sweetness spilling bliss,<br>
Feet glimmering upon the sunstone courts of mind,<br>
Heaven’s cupbearers bore round the Eternal’s wine.<br>
A tangle of bright bodies, of moved souls<br>
Tracing the close and intertwined delight,<br>
The harmonious tread of lives for ever joined<br>
In the passionate oneness of a mystic joy<br>
As if sunbeams made living and divine,<br>
The golden-bosomed Apsara goddesses,<br>
In groves flooded from an argent disk of bliss<br>
That floated through a luminous sapphire dream,<br>
In a cloud of raiment lit with golden limbs<br>
And gleaming footfalls treading faery swards,<br>

Who know their riot for a dance of God,<br>
Whirled linked in moonlit revels of the heart.<br>
Impeccable artists of unerring forms,<br>
Magician builders of sound and rhythmic words,<br>
Wind-haired Gandharvas chanted to the ear<br>
The odes that shape the universal thought,<br>
The lines that tear the veil from Deity’s face,<br>
The rhythms that bring the sounds of wisdom’s sea.<br>
Immortal figures and illumined brows,<br>
Our great forefathers in those splendours moved;<br>
Termless in power and satisfied of light,<br>
They enjoyed the sense of all for which we strive.<br>
High seers, moved poets saw the eternal thoughts<br>
That, travellers from on high, arrive to us<br>
Deformed by our search, tricked by costuming mind,<br>
Like gods disfigured by the pangs of birth,<br>
Seized the great words which now are frail sounds caught<br>
By difficult rapture on a mortal tongue.<br>
The strong who stumble and sin were calm proud gods.<br>
There lightning-filled with glory and with flame,<br>
Melting in waves of sympathy and sight,<br>
Smitten like a lyre that throbs to others’ bliss,<br>
Drawn by the cords of ecstasies unknown,<br>
Her human nature faint with heaven’s delight,<br>
She beheld the clasp to earth denied and bore<br>
The imperishable eyes of veilless love.<br>
More climbed above, level to level reached,<br>
Beyond what tongue can utter or mind dream:<br>
Worlds of an infinite reach crowned Nature’s stir.<br>
There was a greater tranquil sweetness there,<br>
A subtler and profounder ether’s field<br>
And mightier scheme than heavenliest sense can give.<br>
There breath carried a stream of seeing mind,<br>
Form was a tenuous raiment of the soul:<br>
Colour was a visible tone of ecstasy;<br>
Shapes seen half immaterial by the gaze<br>

<br>
And yet voluptuously palpable<br>
Made sensible to touch the indwelling spirit.<br>
The high perfected sense illumined lived<br>
A happy vassal of the inner ray,<br>
Each feeling was the Eternal’s mighty child<br>
And every thought was a sweet burning god.<br>
Air was a luminous feeling, sound a voice,<br>
Sunlight the soul’s vision and moonlight its dream.<br>
On a wide living base of wordless calm<br>
All was a potent and a lucid joy.<br>
Into those heights her spirit went floating up<br>
Like an upsoaring bird who mounts unseen<br>
Voicing to the ascent his throbbing heart<br>
Of melody till a pause of closing wings<br>
Comes quivering in his last contented cry<br>
And he is silent with his soul discharged,<br>
Delivered of his heart’s burden of delight.<br>
Experience mounted on joy’s coloured breast<br>
To inaccessible spheres in spiral flight.<br>
There Time dwelt with eternity as one;<br>
Immense felicity joined rapt repose.<br>
As one drowned in a sea of splendour and bliss,<br>
Mute in the maze of these surprising worlds,<br>
Turning she saw their living knot and source,<br>
Key to their charm and fount of their delight,<br>
And knew him for the same who snares our lives<br>
Captured in his terrifying pitiless net,<br>
And makes the universe his prison camp<br>
And makes in his immense and vacant vasts<br>
The labour of the stars a circuit vain<br>
And death the end of every human road<br>
And grief and pain the wages of man’s toil.<br>
One whom her soul had faced as Death and Night<br>
A sum of all sweetness gathered into his limbs<br>
And blinded her heart to the beauty of the suns.<br>

Transfigured was the formidable shape.<br>
His darkness and his sad destroying might<br>
Abolishing for ever and disclosing<br>
The mystery of his high and violent deeds,<br>
A secret splendour rose revealed to sight<br>
Where once the vast embodied Void had stood.<br>
Night the dim mask had grown a wonderful face.<br>
The vague infinity was slain whose gloom<br>
Had outlined from the terrible unknown<br>
The obscure disastrous figure of a god,<br>
Fled was the error that arms the hands of grief,<br>
And lighted the ignorant gulf whose hollow deeps<br>
Had given to nothingness a dreadful voice.<br>
As when before the eye that wakes in sleep<br>
Is opened the sombre binding of a book,<br>
Illumined letterings are seen which kept<br>
A golden blaze of thought inscribed within,<br>
A marvellous form responded to her gaze<br>
Whose sweetness justified life’s blindest pain;<br>
All Nature’s struggle was its easy price,<br>
The universe and its agony seemed worth while.<br>
As if the choric calyx of a flower<br>
Aerial, visible on music’s waves,<br>
A lotus of light-petalled ecstasy<br>
Took shape out of the tremulous heart of things.<br>
There was no more the torment under the stars,<br>
The evil sheltered behind Nature’s mask;<br>
There was no more the dark pretence of hate,<br>
The cruel rictus on Love’s altered face.<br>
Hate was the grip of a dreadful amour’s strife;<br>
A ruthless love intent only to possess<br>
Has here replaced the sweet original god.<br>
Forgetting the Will-to-love that gave it birth,<br>
The passion to lock itself in and to unite,<br>
It would swallow all into one lonely self,<br>
Devouring the soul that it had made its own,<br>

By suffering and annihilation’s pain<br>
Punishing the unwillingness to be one,<br>
Angry with the refusals of the world,<br>
Passionate to take but knowing not how to give.<br>
Death’s sombre cowl was cast from Nature’s brow;<br>
There lightened on her the godhead’s lurking laugh.<br>
All grace and glory and all divinity<br>
Were here collected in a single form;<br>
All worshipped eyes looked through his from one face;<br>
He bore all godheads in his grandiose limbs.<br>
An oceanic spirit dwelt within;<br>
Intolerant and invincible in joy<br>
A flood of freedom and transcendent bliss<br>
Into immortal lines of beauty rose.<br>
In him the fourfold Being bore its crown<br>
That wears the mystery of a nameless Name,<br>
The universe writing its tremendous sense<br>
In the inexhaustible meaning of a word.<br>
In him the architect of the visible world,<br>
At once the art and artist of his works,<br>
Spirit and seer and thinker of things seen,<br>
Virat, who lights his camp-fires in the suns<br>
And the star-entangled ether is his hold,<br>
Expressed himself with Matter for his speech:<br>
Objects are his letters, forces are his words,<br>
Events are the crowded history of his life,<br>
And sea and land are the pages for his tale.<br>
Matter is his means and his spiritual sign;<br>
He hangs the thought upon a lash’s lift,<br>
In the current of the blood makes flow the soul.<br>
His is the dumb will of atom and of clod;<br>
A Will that without sense or motive acts,<br>
An Intelligence needing not to think or plan,<br>
The world creates itself invincibly;<br>
For its body is the body of the Lord<br>
And in its heart stands Virat, King of Kings.<br>

In him shadows his form the Golden Child<br>
Who in the Sun-capped Vast cradles his birth:<br>
Hiranyagarbha, author of thoughts and dreams,<br>
Who sees the invisible and hears the sounds<br>
That never visited a mortal ear,<br>
Discoverer of unthought realities<br>
Truer to Truth than all we have ever known,<br>
He is the leader on the inner roads;<br>
A seer, he has entered the forbidden realms;<br>
A magician with the omnipotent wand of thought,<br>
He builds the secret uncreated worlds.<br>
Armed with the golden speech, the diamond eye,<br>
His is the vision and the prophecy:<br>
Imagist casting the formless into shape,<br>
Traveller and hewer of the unseen paths,<br>
He is the carrier of the hidden fire,<br>
He is the voice of the Ineffable,<br>
He is the invisible hunter of the light,<br>
The Angel of mysterious ecstasies,<br>
The conqueror of the kingdoms of the soul.<br>
A third spirit stood behind, their hidden cause,<br>
A mass of superconscience closed in light,<br>
Creator of things in his all-knowing sleep.<br>
All from his stillness came as grows a tree;<br>
He is our seed and core, our head and base.<br>
All light is but a flash from his closed eyes:<br>
An all-wise Truth is mystic in his heart,<br>
The omniscient Ray is shut behind his lids:<br>
He is the Wisdom that comes not by thought,<br>
His wordless silence brings the immortal word.<br>
He sleeps in the atom and the burning star,<br>
He sleeps in man and god and beast and stone:<br>
Because he is there the Inconscient does its work,<br>
Because he is there the world forgets to die.<br>
He is the centre of the circle of God,<br>
He the circumference of Nature’s run.<br>

His slumber is an Almightiness in things,<br>
Awake, he is the Eternal and Supreme.<br>
Above was the brooding bliss of the Infinite,<br>
Its omniscient and omnipotent repose,<br>
Its immobile silence absolute and alone.<br>
All powers were woven in countless concords here.<br>
The bliss that made the world in his body lived,<br>
Love and delight were the head of the sweet form.<br>
In the alluring meshes of their snare<br>
Recaptured, the proud blissful members held<br>
All joys outrunners of the panting heart<br>
And fugitive from life’s outstripped desire.<br>
Whatever vision has escaped the eye,<br>
Whatever happiness comes in dream and trance,<br>
The nectar spilled by love with trembling hands,<br>
The joy the cup of Nature cannot hold,<br>
Had crowded to the beauty of his face,<br>
Were waiting in the honey of his laugh.<br>
Things hidden by the silence of the hours,<br>
The ideas that find no voice on living lips,<br>
The soul’s pregnant meeting with infinity<br>
Had come to birth in him and taken fire:<br>
The secret whisper of the flower and star<br>
Revealed its meaning in his fathomless look.<br>
His lips curved eloquent like a rose of dawn;<br>
His smile that played with the wonder of the mind<br>
And stayed in the heart when it had left his mouth<br>
Glimmered with the radiance of the morning star<br>
Gemming the wide discovery of heaven.<br>
His gaze was the regard of eternity;<br>
The spirit of its sweet and calm intent<br>
Was a wise home of gladness and divulged<br>
The light of the ages in the mirth of the hours,<br>
A sun of wisdom in a miracled grove.<br>

Rich-hearted, wonderful to each other met<br>
In the mutual marvelling of their myriad notes<br>
And dwelt like brothers of one family<br>
Who had found their common and mysterious home.<br>
As from the harp of some ecstatic god<br>
There springs a harmony of lyric bliss<br>
Striving to leave no heavenly joy unsung,<br>
Such was the life in that embodied Light.<br>
He seemed the wideness of a boundless sky,<br>
He seemed the passion of a sorrowless earth,<br>
He seemed the burning of a world-wide sun.<br>
Two looked upon each other, Soul saw Soul.<br>
Then like an anthem from the heart’s lucent cave<br>
A voice soared up whose magic sound could turn<br>
The poignant weeping of the earth to sobs<br>
Of rapture and her cry to spirit song.<br>
“O human image of the deathless word,<br>
How hast thou seen beyond the topaz walls<br>
The gleaming sisters of the divine gate,<br>
Summoned the genii of their wakeful sleep,<br>
And under revelation’s arches forced<br>
The carved thought-shrouded doors to swing apart,<br>
Unlocked the avenues of spiritual sight<br>
And taught the entries of a heavenlier state<br>
To thy rapt soul that bore the golden key?<br>
In thee the secret sight man’s blindness missed<br>
Has opened its view past Time, my chariot-course,<br>
And death, my tunnel which I drive through life<br>
To reach my unseen distances of bliss.<br>
I am the hushed search of the jealous gods<br>
Pursuing my wisdom’s vast mysterious work<br>
Seized in the thousand meeting ways of heaven.<br>
I am the beauty of the unveiled ray<br>
Drawing through the deep roads of the infinite night<br>
The unconquerable pilgrim soul of earth<br>

I am the inviolable Ecstasy;<br>
They who have looked on me, shall grieve no more.<br>
The eyes that live in night shall see my form.<br>
On the pale shores of foaming steely straits<br>
That flow beneath a grey tormented sky,<br>
Two powers from one original ecstasy born<br>
Pace near but parted in the life of man;<br>
One leans to earth, the other yearns to the skies:<br>
Heaven in its rapture dreams of perfect earth,<br>
Earth in its sorrow dreams of perfect heaven.<br>
The two longing to join, yet walk apart,<br>
Idly divided by their vain conceits;<br>
They are kept from their oneness by enchanted fears;<br>
Sundered mysteriously by miles of thought,<br>
They gaze across the silent gulfs of sleep.<br>
Or side by side reclined upon my vasts<br>
Like bride and bridegroom magically divorced<br>
They wake to yearn, but never can they clasp<br>
While thinly flickering hesitates uncrossed<br>
Between the lovers on their nuptial couch<br>
The shadowy eidolon of a sword.<br>
But when the phantom flame-edge fails undone,<br>
Then never more can space or time divide<br>
The lover from the loved; Space shall draw back<br>
Her great translucent curtain, Time shall be<br>
The quivering of the spirit’s endless bliss.<br>
Attend that moment of celestial fate.<br>
Meanwhile you two shall serve the dual law<br>
Which only now the scouts of vision glimpse<br>
Who pressing through the forest of their thoughts<br>
Have found the narrow bridges of the gods.<br>
Wait patient of the brittle bars of form<br>

Of happy oneness rapturously enhanced<br>

On Savitri listening in her tranquil heart<br>
To the harmony of the ensnaring voice<br>

I have felt a secret spirit stir in things<br>
Carrying the body of the growing God:<br>
It looks through veiling forms at veilless truth;<br>
It pushes back the curtain of the gods;<br>
It climbs towards its own eternity.”<br>
But the god answered to the woman’s heart:<br>
“O living power of the incarnate Word,<br>
All that the Spirit has dreamed thou canst create:<br>
Thou art the force by which I made the worlds,<br>
Thou art my vision and my will and voice.<br>
But knowledge too is thine, the world-plan thou knowest<br>
And the tardy process of the pace of Time.<br>
In the impetuous drive of thy heart of flame,<br>
In thy passion to deliver man and earth,<br>
Indignant at the impediments of Time<br>
And the slow evolution’s sluggard steps,<br>
Lead not the spirit in an ignorant world<br>
To dare too soon the adventure of the Light,<br>
Pushing the bound and slumbering god in man<br>
Awakened mid the ineffable silences<br>
Into endless vistas of the unknown and unseen,<br>
Across the last confines of the limiting Mind<br>
And the Superconscient’s perilous border line<br>
Into the danger of the Infinite.<br>

<br>
But if thou wilt not wait for Time and God,<br>
Do then thy work and force thy will on Fate.<br>
As I have taken from thee my load of night<br>
And taken from thee my twilight’s doubts and dreams,<br>
So now I take my light of utter Day.<br>
These are my symbol kingdoms but not here<br>
Can the great choice be made that fixes fate<br>
Or uttered the sanction of the Voice supreme.<br>
Arise upon a ladder of greater worlds<br>
To the infinity where no world can be.<br>
But not in the wide air where a greater Life<br>
Uplifts its mystery and its miracle,<br>
And not on the luminous peaks of summit Mind,<br>
Or in the hold where subtle Matter’s spirit<br>
Hides in its light of shimmering secrecies,<br>
Can there be heard the Eternal’s firm command<br>
That joins the head of destiny to its base.<br>
These only are the mediating links;<br>
Not theirs is the originating sight<br>
Nor the fulfilling act or last support<br>
That bears perpetually the cosmic pile.<br>
Two are the Powers that hold the ends of Time;<br>
Spirit foresees, Matter unfolds its thought,<br>
The dumb executor of God’s decrees,<br>
Omitting no iota and no dot,<br>
Agent unquestioning, inconscient, stark,<br>
Evolving inevitably a charged content,<br>
Intention of his force in Time and Space,<br>
In animate beings and inanimate things;<br>
Immutably it fulfils its ordered task,<br>
It cancels not a tittle of things done;<br>
Unswerving from the oracular command<br>
It alters not the steps of the Unseen.<br>
If thou must indeed deliver man and earth<br>
On the spiritual heights look down on life,<br>
Discover the truth of God and man and world;<br>

<br>
Then do thy task knowing and seeing all.<br>
Ascend, O soul, into thy timeless self;<br>
Choose destiny’s curve and stamp thy will on Time.”<br>
He ended and upon the falling sound<br>
A power went forth that shook the founded spheres<br>
And loosed the stakes that hold the tents of form.<br>
Absolved from vision’s grip and the folds of thought,<br>
Rapt from her sense like disappearing scenes<br>
In the stupendous theatre of Space<br>
The heaven-worlds vanished in spiritual light.<br>
A movement was abroad, a cry, a word,<br>
Beginningless in its vast discovery,<br>
Momentless in its unthinkable return:<br>
Choired in calm seas she heard the eternal Thought<br>
Rhythming itself abroad unutterably<br>
In spaceless orbits and on timeless roads.<br>
In an ineffable world she lived fulfilled.<br>
An energy of the triune Infinite,<br>
In a measureless Reality she dwelt,<br>
A rapture and a being and a force,<br>
A linked and myriad-motioned plenitude,<br>
A virgin unity, a luminous spouse,<br>
Housing a multitudinous embrace<br>
To marry all in God’s immense delight,<br>
Bearing the eternity of every spirit,<br>
Bearing the burden of universal love,<br>
A wonderful mother of unnumbered souls.<br>
All things she knew, all things imagined or willed:<br>
Her ear was opened to ideal sound,<br>
Shape the convention bound no more her sight,<br>
A thousand doors of oneness was her heart.<br>
A crypt and sanctuary of brooding light<br>
Appeared, the last recess of things beyond.<br>
Then in its rounds the enormous fiat paused,<br>
Silence gave back to the Unknowable<br>
All it had given. Still was her listening thought.<br>
<br>
695<br>
<br>
BOOK XI: The Book of Everlasting Day<br>
<br>
The form of things had ceased within her soul.<br>
Invisible that perfect godhead now.<br>
Around her some tremendous spirit lived,<br>
Mysterious flame around a melting pearl,<br>
And in the phantom of abolished Space<br>
There was a voice unheard by ears that cried:<br>
“Choose, spirit, thy supreme choice not given again;<br>
For now from my highest being looks at thee<br>
The nameless formless peace where all things rest.<br>
In a happy vast sublime cessation know, —<br>
An immense extinction in eternity,<br>
A point that disappears in the infinite, —<br>
Felicity of the extinguished flame,<br>
Last sinking of a wave in a boundless sea,<br>
End of the trouble of thy wandering thoughts,<br>
Close of the journeying of thy pilgrim soul.<br>
Accept, O music, weariness of thy notes,<br>
O stream, wide breaking of thy channel banks.”<br>
The moments fell into eternity.<br>
But someone yearned within a bosom unknown<br>
And silently the woman’s heart replied:<br>
“Thy peace, O Lord, a boon within to keep<br>
Amid the roar and ruin of wild Time<br>
For the magnificent soul of man on earth.<br>
Thy calm, O Lord, that bears thy hands of joy.”<br>
Limitless like ocean round a lonely isle<br>
A second time the eternal cry arose:<br>
“Wide open are the ineffable gates in front.<br>
My spirit leans down to break the knot of earth,<br>
Amorous of oneness without thought or sign<br>
To cast down wall and fence, to strip heaven bare,<br>
See with the large eye of infinity,<br>
Unweave the stars and into silence pass.”<br>
In an immense and world-destroying pause<br>
She heard a million creatures cry to her.<br>
Through the tremendous stillness of her thoughts<br>
<br>
696<br>
<br>
The Soul’s Choice and the Supreme Consummation<br>
<br>
Immeasurably the woman’s nature spoke:<br>
“Thy oneness, Lord, in many approaching hearts,<br>
My sweet infinity of thy numberless souls.”<br>
Mightily retreating like a sea in ebb<br>
A third time swelled the great admonishing call:<br>
“I spread abroad the refuge of my wings.<br>
Out of its incommunicable deeps<br>
My power looks forth of mightiest splendour, stilled<br>
Into its majesty of sleep, withdrawn<br>
Above the dreadful whirlings of the world.”<br>
A sob of things was answer to the voice,<br>
And passionately the woman’s heart replied:<br>
“Thy energy, Lord, to seize on woman and man,<br>
To take all things and creatures in their grief<br>
And gather them into a mother’s arms.”<br>
Solemn and distant like a seraph’s lyre<br>
A last great time the warning sound was heard:<br>
“I open the wide eye of solitude<br>
To uncover the voiceless rapture of my bliss,<br>
Where in a pure and exquisite hush it lies<br>
Motionless in its slumber of ecstasy,<br>
Resting from the sweet madness of the dance<br>
Out of whose beat the throb of hearts was born.”<br>
Breaking the Silence with appeal and cry<br>
A hymn of adoration tireless climbed,<br>
A music beat of winged uniting souls,<br>
Then all the woman yearningly replied:<br>
“Thy embrace which rends the living knot of pain,<br>
Thy joy, O Lord, in which all creatures breathe,<br>
Thy magic flowing waters of deep love,<br>
Thy sweetness give to me for earth and men.”<br>
Then after silence a still blissful cry<br>
Began, such as arose from the Infinite<br>
When the first whisperings of a strange delight<br>
Imagined in its deep the joy to seek,<br>
<br>
697<br>

BOOK XI: The Book of Everlasting Day<br>

The passion to discover and to touch,<br>
The enamoured laugh which rhymed the chanting worlds:<br>
“O beautiful body of the incarnate Word,<br>
Thy thoughts are mine, I have spoken with thy voice.<br>
My will is thine, what thou hast chosen I choose:<br>
All thou hast asked I give to earth and men.<br>
All shall be written out in destiny’s book<br>
By my trustee of thought and plan and act,<br>
The executor of my will, eternal Time.<br>
But since thou hast refused my maimless Calm<br>

The visage of Space and the shape of Time is lost,<br>
And from happy extinction of thy separate self<br>
In my uncompanioned lone eternity, —<br>
For not for thee the nameless worldless Nought,<br>
Annihilation of thy living soul<br>
And the end of thought and hope and life and love<br>
In the blank measureless Unknowable, —<br>
I lay my hands upon thy soul of flame,<br>
I lay my hands upon thy heart of love,<br>
I yoke thee to my power of work in Time.<br>
Because thou hast obeyed my timeless will,<br>
Because thou hast chosen to share earth’s struggle and fate<br>
And leaned in pity over earth-bound men<br>
And turned aside to help and yearned to save,<br>
I bind by thy heart’s passion thy heart to mine<br>
And lay my splendid yoke upon thy soul.<br>
Now will I do in thee my marvellous works.<br>
I will fasten thy nature with my cords of strength,<br>
Subdue to my delight thy spirit’s limbs<br>
And make thee a vivid knot of all my bliss<br>
And build in thee my proud and crystal home.<br>

Decreed since the beginning of the worlds<br>
In the deep essence of created things:<br>
Even there shall come as a high crown of all<br>
The end of Death, the death of Ignorance.<br>
But first high Truth must set her feet on earth<br>
And man aspire to the Eternal’s light<br>
And all his members feel the Spirit’s touch<br>
And all his life obey an inner Force.<br>
This too shall be; for a new life shall come,<br>
A body of the Superconscient’s truth,<br>
A native field of Supernature’s mights:<br>
It shall make earth’s nescient ground Truth’s colony,<br>
Make even the Ignorance a transparent robe<br>
Through which shall shine the brilliant limbs of Truth<br>
And Truth shall be a sun on Nature’s head<br>
And Truth shall be the guide of Nature’s steps<br>
And Truth shall gaze out of her nether deeps.<br>
When superman is born as Nature’s king<br>
His presence shall transfigure Matter’s world:<br>

He shall light up Truth’s fire in Nature’s night,<br>
He shall lay upon the earth Truth’s greater law;<br>
Man too shall turn towards the Spirit’s call.<br>
Awake to his hidden possibility,<br>
Awake to all that slept within his heart<br>
And all that Nature meant when earth was formed<br>
And the Spirit made this ignorant world his home,<br>
He shall aspire to Truth and God and Bliss.<br>
Interpreter of a diviner law<br>
And instrument of a supreme design,<br>
The higher kind shall lean to lift up man.<br>
Man shall desire to climb to his own heights.<br>
The truth above shall wake a nether truth,<br>
Even the dumb earth become a sentient force.<br>
The Spirit’s tops and Nature’s base shall draw<br>
Near to the secret of their separate truth<br>
And know each other as one deity.<br>
The Spirit shall look out through Matter’s gaze<br>
And Matter shall reveal the Spirit’s face.<br>
Then man and superman shall be at one<br>
And all the earth become a single life.<br>
Even the multitude shall hear the Voice<br>
And turn to commune with the Spirit within<br>
And strive to obey the high spiritual law:<br>
This earth shall stir with impulses sublime,<br>
Humanity awake to deepest self,<br>
Nature the hidden godhead recognise.<br>
Even the many shall some answer make<br>
And bear the splendour of the Divine’s rush<br>
And his impetuous knock at unseen doors.<br>
A heavenlier passion shall upheave men’s lives,<br>
Their mind shall share in the ineffable gleam,<br>
Their heart shall feel the ecstasy and the fire.<br>
Earth’s bodies shall be conscious of a soul;<br>
Mortality’s bondslaves shall unloose their bonds,<br>
Mere men into spiritual beings grow<br>

Intuitive beams shall touch the nature’s peaks,<br>
A revelation stir the nature’s depths;<br>
The Truth shall be the leader of their lives,<br>
Truth shall dictate their thought and speech and act,<br>
They shall feel themselves lifted nearer to the sky,<br>

For knowledge shall pour down in radiant streams<br>
And even darkened mind quiver with new life<br>
And kindle and burn with the Ideal’s fire<br>
And turn to escape from mortal ignorance.<br>
The frontiers of the Ignorance shall recede,<br>
More and more souls shall enter into light,<br>
Minds lit, inspired, the occult summoner hear<br>
And lives blaze with a sudden inner flame<br>
And hearts grow enamoured of divine delight<br>
And human wills tune to the divine will,<br>
These separate selves the Spirit’s oneness feel,<br>
These senses of heavenly sense grow capable,<br>
The flesh and nerves of a strange ethereal joy<br>
And mortal bodies of immortality.<br>
A divine force shall flow through tissue and cell<br>
And take the charge of breath and speech and act<br>
And all the thoughts shall be a glow of suns<br>
And every feeling a celestial thrill.<br>
Often a lustrous inner dawn shall come<br>
Lighting the chambers of the slumbering mind;<br>
A sudden bliss shall run through every limb<br>
And Nature with a mightier Presence fill.<br>
Thus shall the earth open to divinity<br>
And common natures feel the wide uplift,<br>
Illumine common acts with the Spirit’s ray<br>
And meet the deity in common things.<br>
Nature shall live to manifest secret God,<br>
The Spirit shall take up the human play,<br>
This earthly life become the life divine.”<br>

<br>
The measure of that subtle music ceased.<br>
Down with a hurried swimming floating lapse<br>
Through unseen worlds and bottomless spaces forced<br>
Sank like a star the soul of Savitri.<br>
Amidst a laughter of unearthly lyres<br>
She heard around her nameless voices cry<br>
Triumphing, an innumerable sound.<br>
A choir of rushing winds to meet her came.<br>
She bore the burden of infinity<br>
And felt the stir of all ethereal space.<br>
Pursuing her in her fall, implacably sweet,<br>
A face was over her which seemed a youth’s,<br>
Symbol of all the beauty eyes see not,<br>
Crowned as with peacock plumes of gorgeous hue<br>
Framing a sapphire, whose heart-disturbing smile<br>
Insatiably attracted to delight,<br>
Voluptuous to the embraces of her soul.<br>
Changed in its shape, yet rapturously the same,<br>
It grew a woman’s dark and beautiful<br>
Like a mooned night with drifting star-gemmed clouds,<br>
A shadowy glory and a stormy depth,<br>
Turbulent in will and terrible in love.<br>
Eyes in which Nature’s blind ecstatic life<br>
Sprang from some spirit’s passionate content,<br>
Missioned her to the whirling dance of earth.<br>
Amidst the headlong rapture of her fall<br>
Held like a bird in a child’s satisfied hands,<br>
In an enamoured grasp her spirit strove<br>
Admitting no release till Time should end,<br>
And, as the fruit of the mysterious joy,<br>
She kept within her strong embosoming soul<br>
Like a flower hidden in the heart of spring<br>
The soul of Satyavan drawn down by her<br>
Inextricably in that mighty lapse.<br>
Invisible heavens in a thronging flight<br>
Soared past her as she fell. Then all the blind<br>

<br>
And near attraction of the earth compelled<br>
Fearful rapidities of downward bliss.<br>
Lost in the giddy proneness of that speed,<br>
Whirled, sinking, overcome she disappeared,<br>
Like a leaf spinning from the tree of heaven,<br>
In broad unconsciousness as in a pool;<br>
A hospitable softness drew her in<br>
Into a wonder of miraculous depths,<br>
Above her closed a darkness of great wings<br>
And she was buried in a mother’s breast.<br>
Then from a timeless plane that watches Time,<br>
A Spirit gazed out upon destiny,<br>
In its endless moment saw the ages pass.<br>
All still was in a silence of the gods.<br>
The prophet moment covered limitless Space<br>
And cast into the heart of hurrying Time<br>
A diamond light of the Eternal’s peace,<br>
A crimson seed of God’s felicity;<br>
A glance from the gaze fell of undying Love.<br>
A wonderful face looked out with deathless eyes;<br>
A hand was seen drawing the golden bars<br>
That guard the imperishable secrecies.<br>
A key turned in a mystic lock of Time.<br>
But where the silence of the gods had passed,<br>
A greater harmony from the stillness born<br>
Surprised with joy and sweetness yearning hearts,<br>
An ecstasy and a laughter and a cry.<br>
A power leaned down, a happiness found its home.<br>
Over wide earth brooded the infinite bliss.<br>

<br>
The Return to Earth<br>
OUT OF abysmal trance her spirit woke.<br>
Lain on the earth-mother’s calm inconscient breast<br>
She saw the green-clad branches lean above<br>
Guarding her sleep with their enchanted life,<br>
And overhead a blue-winged ecstasy<br>
Fluttered from bough to bough with high-pitched call.<br>
Into the magic secrecy of the woods<br>
Peering through an emerald lattice-window of leaves,<br>
In indolent skies reclined, the thinning day<br>
Turned to its slow fall into evening’s peace.<br>
She pressed the living body of Satyavan:<br>
On her body’s wordless joy to be and breathe<br>
She bore the blissful burden of his head<br>
Between her breasts’ warm labour of delight,<br>
The waking gladness of her members felt<br>
The weight of heaven in his limbs, a touch<br>
Summing the whole felicity of things,<br>
And all her life was conscious of his life<br>
And all her being rejoiced enfolding his.<br>
The immense remoteness of her trance had passed;<br>
Human she was once more, earth’s Savitri,<br>
Yet felt in her illimitable change.<br>
A power dwelt in her soul too great for earth,<br>
A bliss lived in her heart too large for heaven;<br>
Light too intense for thought and love too boundless<br>
For earth’s emotions lit her skies of mind<br>
And spread through her deep and happy seas of soul.<br>
All that is sacred in the world drew near<br>
To her divine passivity of mood.<br>
A marvellous voice of silence breathed its thoughts.<br>
All things in Time and Space she had taken for hers;<br>
<br>
BOOK XII: Epilogue<br>
<br>
In her they moved, by her they lived and were,<br>
The whole wide world clung to her for delight,<br>
Created for her rapt embrace of love.<br>
Now in her spaceless self released from bounds<br>
Unnumbered years seemed moments long drawn out,<br>
The brilliant time-flakes of eternity.<br>
Outwingings of a bird from its bright home,<br>
Her earthly morns were radiant flights of joy.<br>
Boundless she was, a form of infinity.<br>
Absorbed no longer by the moment’s beat<br>
Her spirit the unending future felt<br>
And lived with all the unbeginning past.<br>
Her life was a dawn’s victorious opening,<br>
The past and unborn days had joined their dreams,<br>
Old vanished eves and far arriving noons<br>
Hinted to her a vision of prescient hours.<br>
Supine in musing bliss she lay awhile<br>
Given to the wonder of a waking trance;<br>
Half-risen then she sent her gaze around,<br>
As if to recover old sweet trivial threads,<br>
Old happy thoughts, small treasured memories,<br>
And weave them into one immortal day.<br>
Ever she held on the paradise of her breast<br>
Her lover charmed into a fathomless sleep,<br>
Lain like an infant spirit unaware<br>
Lulled on the verge of two consenting worlds.<br>
But soon she leaned down over her loved to call<br>
His mind back to her with her travelling touch<br>
On his closed eyelids; settled was her still look<br>
Of strong delight, not yearning now, but large<br>
With limitless joy or sovereign last content,<br>
Pure, passionate with the passion of the gods.<br>
Desire stirred not its wings; for all was made<br>
An overarching of celestial rays<br>
Like the absorbed control of sky on plain,<br>
Heaven’s leaning down to embrace from all sides earth,<br>
<br>

The Return to Earth<br>
<br>
A quiet rapture, a vast security.<br>
Then sighing to her touch the soft-winged sleep<br>
Rose hovering from his flowerlike lids and flew<br>
Murmurous away. Awake, he found her eyes<br>
Waiting for his, and felt her hands, and saw<br>
The earth his home given back to him once more<br>
And her made his again, his passion’s all.<br>
With his arms’ encircling hold around her locked,<br>
A living knot to make possession close,<br>
He murmured with hesitating lips her name,<br>
And vaguely recollecting wonder cried,<br>
“Whence hast thou brought me captive back, love-chained,<br>
To thee and sunlight’s walls, O golden beam<br>
And casket of all sweetness, Savitri,<br>
Godhead and woman, moonlight of my soul?<br>
For surely I have travelled in strange worlds<br>
By thee companioned, a pursuing spirit,<br>
Together we have disdained the gates of night.<br>
I have turned away from the celestials’ joy<br>
And heaven’s insufficient without thee.<br>
Where now has passed that formidable Shape<br>
Which rose against us, the Spirit of the Void,<br>
Claiming the world for Death and Nothingness,<br>
Denying God and soul? Or was all a dream<br>
Or a vision seen in a spiritual sleep,<br>
A symbol of the oppositions of Time<br>
Or a mind-lit beacon of significance<br>
In some stress of darkness lighting on the Way<br>
Or guiding a swimmer through the straits of Death,<br>
Or finding with the succour of its ray<br>
In a gully mid the crowded streets of Chance<br>
The soul that into the world-adventure came,<br>
A scout and voyager from Eternity?”<br>
But she replied, “Our parting was the dream;<br>
We are together, we live, O Satyavan.<br>
Look round thee and behold, glad and unchanged<br>

<br>
Our home, this forest with its thousand cries<br>
And the whisper of the wind among the leaves<br>
And, through rifts in emerald scene, the evening sky,<br>
God’s canopy of blue sheltering our lives,<br>
And the birds crying for heart’s happiness,<br>
Winged poets of our solitary reign,<br>
Our friends on earth where we are king and queen.<br>
Only our souls have left Death’s night behind,<br>
Changed by a mighty dream’s reality,<br>
Illumined by the light of symbol worlds<br>
And the stupendous summit self of things,<br>
And stood at Godhead’s gates limitless, free.”<br>
Then filled with the glory of their happiness<br>
They rose and with safe clinging fingers locked<br>
Hung on each other in a silent look.<br>
But he with a new wonder in his heart<br>
And a new flame of worship in his eyes:<br>
“What high change is in thee, O Savitri? Bright<br>
Ever thou wast, a goddess still and pure,<br>
Yet dearer to me by thy sweet human parts<br>
Earth gave thee making thee yet more divine.<br>
My adoration mastered, my desire<br>
Bent down to make its subject, my daring clasped,<br>
Claiming by body and soul my life’s estate,<br>
Rapture’s possession, love’s sweet property,<br>
A statue of silence in my templed spirit,<br>
A yearning godhead and a golden bride.<br>
But now thou seemst almost too high and great<br>
For mortal worship; Time lies below thy feet<br>
And the whole world seems only a part of thee,<br>
Thy presence the hushed heaven I inhabit,<br>
And thou lookst on me in the gaze of the stars,<br>
Yet art the earthly keeper of my soul,<br>
My life a whisper of thy dreaming thoughts,<br>
My morns a gleaming of thy spirit’s wings,<br>
And day and night are of thy beauty part.<br>
<br>
718<br>
<br>
The Return to Earth<br>
<br>
Hast thou not taken my heart to treasure it<br>
In the secure environment of thy breast?<br>
Awakened from the silence and the sleep,<br>
I have consented for thy sake to be.<br>
By thee I have greatened my mortal arc of life,<br>
But now far heavens, unmapped infinitudes<br>
Thou hast brought me, thy illimitable gift!<br>
If to fill these thou lift thy sacred flight,<br>
My human earth will still demand thy bliss.<br>
Make still my life through thee a song of joy<br>
And all my silence wide and deep with thee.”<br>
A heavenly queen consenting to his will,<br>
She clasped his feet, by her enshrining hair<br>
Enveloped in a velvet cloak of love,<br>
And answered softly like a murmuring lute:<br>
“All now is changed, yet all is still the same.<br>
Lo, we have looked upon the face of God,<br>
Our life has opened with divinity.<br>
We have borne identity with the Supreme<br>
And known his meaning in our mortal lives.<br>
Our love has grown greater by that mighty touch<br>
And learned its heavenly significance,<br>
Yet nothing is lost of mortal love’s delight.<br>
Heaven’s touch fulfils but cancels not our earth:<br>
Our bodies need each other in the same last;<br>
Still in our breasts repeat heavenly secret rhythm<br>
Our human heart-beats passionately close.<br>
Still am I she who came to thee mid the murmur<br>
Of sunlit leaves upon this forest verge;<br>
I am the Madran, I am Savitri.<br>
All that I was before, I am to thee still,<br>
Close comrade of thy thoughts and hopes and toils,<br>
All happy contraries I would join for thee.<br>
All sweet relations marry in our life;<br>

The sovereign and the slave of thy desire,<br>

And mother of thy wants; thou art my world,<br>

The world I inhabit and the god I adore.<br>
Thy body is my body’s counterpart<br>
Whose every limb my answering limb desires,<br>
Whose heart is key to all my heart-beats, — this<br>
I am and thou to me, O Satyavan.<br>
Our wedded walk through life begins anew,<br>
No gladness lost, no depth of mortal joy.<br>
Let us go through this new world that is the same,<br>
For it is given back, but it is known,<br>
A playing-ground and dwelling-house of God<br>
Who hides himself in bird and beast and man<br>
Sweetly to find himself again by love,<br>
By oneness. His presence leads the rhythms of life<br>
That seek for mutual joy in spite of pain.<br>
We have each other found, O Satyavan,<br>
In the great light of the discovered soul.<br>
Let us go back, for eve is in the skies.<br>
Now grief is dead and serene bliss remains<br>
The heart of all our days for evermore.<br>
Lo, all these beings in this wonderful world!<br>
Let us give joy to all, for joy is ours.<br>
For not for ourselves alone our spirits came<br>
Out of the veil of the Unmanifest,<br>
Out of the deep immense Unknowable<br>
Upon the ignorant breast of dubious earth,<br>
Into the ways of labouring, seeking men,<br>
Two fires that burn towards that parent Sun,<br>
Two rays that travel to the original Light.<br>
To lead man’s soul towards truth and God we are born,<br>
To draw the chequered scheme of mortal life<br>
Into some semblance of the Immortal’s plan,<br>
To shape it closer to an image of God,<br>
A little nearer to the Idea divine.”<br>

She closed her arms about his breast and head<br>
As if to keep him on her bosom worn<br>
For ever through the journeying of the years.<br>
So for a while they stood entwined, their kiss<br>
And passion-tranced embrace a meeting-point<br>
In their commingling spirits one for ever,<br>
Two-souled, two-bodied for the joys of Time.<br>
Then hand in hand they left that solemn place<br>
Full now of mute unusual memories,<br>
To the green distance of their sylvan home<br>
Returning slowly through the forest’s heart.<br>
Round them the afternoon to evening changed;<br>
Light slipped down to the brightly sleeping verge,<br>
And the birds came back winging to their nests,<br>
And day and night leaned to each other’s arms.<br>
Now the dusk shadowy trees stood close around<br>
Like dreaming spirits and, delaying night,<br>
The grey-eyed pensive evening heard their steps,<br>
And from all points the cries and movements came<br>
Of the four-footed wanderers of the night<br>
Approaching. Then a human rumour rose<br>
Long alien to their solitary days,<br>
Invading the charmed wilderness of leaves<br>
Once sacred to secluded loneliness<br>
With violent breaking of its virgin sleep.<br>
Through the screened dusk it deepened still and there neared<br>
Floating of many voices and the sound<br>
Of many feet, till on their sight broke in<br>
As if a coloured wave upon the eye<br>
The brilliant strenuous crowded days of man.<br>
Topped by a flaring multitude of lights<br>
A great resplendent company arrived.<br>
Life in its ordered tumult wavering came<br>
Bringing its stream of unknown faces, thronged<br>
With gold-fringed headdresses, gold-broidered robes,<br>
<br>
BOOK XII: Epilogue<br>

<br>
Glittering of ornaments, fluttering of hems,<br>
Hundreds of hands parted the forest-boughs,<br>
Hundreds of eyes searched the entangled glades.<br>
Calm white-clad priests their grave-eyed sweetness brought,<br>
Strong warriors in their glorious armour shone,<br>
The proud-hooved steeds came trampling through the wood.<br>
In front King Dyumatsena walked, no more<br>
Blind, faltering-limbed, but his far-questing eyes<br>
Restored to all their confidence in light<br>
Took seeingly this imaged outer world;<br>
Firmly he trod with monarch step the soil.<br>
By him that queen and mother’s anxious face<br>
Came changed from its habitual burdened look<br>
Which in its drooping strength of tired toil<br>
Had borne the fallen life of those she loved.<br>
Her patient paleness wore a pensive glow<br>
Like evening’s subdued gaze of gathered light<br>
Departing, which foresees sunrise her child.<br>
Sinking in quiet splendours of her sky,<br>
She lives awhile to muse upon that hope,<br>
The brilliance of her rich receding gleam<br>
A thoughtful prophecy of lyric dawn.<br>
Her eyes were first to find her children’s forms.<br>
But at the vision of the beautiful twain<br>
The air awoke perturbed with scaling cries,<br>
And the swift parents hurrying to their child, —<br>
Their cause of life now who had given him breath, —<br>
Possessed him with their arms. Then tenderly<br>
Cried Dyumatsena chiding Satyavan:<br>
“The fortunate gods have looked on me today,<br>
A kingdom seeking came and heaven’s rays.<br>
But where wast thou? Thou hast tormented gladness<br>
With fear’s dull shadow, O my child, my life.<br>
What danger kept thee for the darkening woods?<br>
Or how could pleasure in her ways forget<br>
That useless orbs without thee are my eyes<br>
<br>
The Return to Earth<br>
<br>
Which only for thy sake rejoice at light?<br>
Not like thyself was this done, Savitri,<br>
Who ledst not back thy husband to our arms,<br>
Knowing with him beside me only is taste<br>
In food and for his touch evening and morn<br>
I live content with my remaining days.”<br>
But Satyavan replied with smiling lips,<br>
“Lay all on her; she is the cause of all.<br>
With her enchantments she has twined me round.<br>
Behold, at noon leaving this house of clay<br>
I wandered in far-off eternities,<br>
Yet still, a captive in her golden hands,<br>
I tread your little hillock called green earth<br>
And in the moments of your transient sun<br>
Live glad among the busy works of men.”<br>
Then all eyes turned their wondering looks where stood,<br>
A deepening redder gold upon her cheeks,<br>
With lowered lids the noble lovely child,<br>
And one consenting thought moved every breast.<br>
“What gleaming marvel of the earth or skies<br>
Stands silently by human Satyavan<br>
To mark a brilliance in the dusk of eve?<br>
If this is she of whom the world has heard,<br>
Wonder no more at any happy change.<br>
Each easy miracle of felicity<br>
Of her transmuting heart the alchemy is.”<br>
Then one spoke there who seemed a priest and sage:<br>
“O woman soul, what light, what power revealed,<br>
Working the rapid marvels of this day,<br>
Opens for us by thee a happier age?”<br>
Her lashes fluttering upwards gathered in<br>
To a vision which had scanned immortal things,<br>
Rejoicing, human forms for their delight.<br>
They claimed for their deep childlike motherhood<br>
The life of all these souls to be her life,<br>
Then falling veiled the light. Low she replied,<br>
<br>
723<br>
<br>

<br>
“Awakened to the meaning of my heart<br>
That to feel love and oneness is to live<br>
And this the magic of our golden change,<br>
Is all the truth I know or seek, O sage.”<br>
Wondering at her and her too luminous words<br>
Westward they turned in the fast-gathering night.<br>
From the entangling verges freed they came<br>
Into a dimness of the sleeping earth<br>
And travelled through her faint and slumbering plains.<br>
Murmur and movement and the tread of men<br>
Broke the night’s solitude; the neigh of steeds<br>
Rose from that indistinct and voiceful sea<br>
Of life and all along its marchings swelled<br>
The rhyme of hooves, the chariot’s homeward voice.<br>
Drawn by white manes upon a high-roofed car<br>
In flare of the unsteady torches went<br>
With linked hands Satyavan and Savitri,<br>
Hearing a marriage march and nuptial hymn,<br>
Where waited them the many-voiced human world.<br>
Numberless the stars swam on their shadowy field<br>
Describing in the gloom the ways of light.<br>
Then while they skirted yet the southward verge,<br>
Lost in the halo of her musing brows<br>
Night, splendid with the moon dreaming in heaven<br>
In silver peace, possessed her luminous reign.<br>
She brooded through her stillness on a thought<br>
Deep-guarded by her mystic folds of light,<br>
And in her bosom nursed a greater dawn.<br>
THE END<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
SAVITRI began as a narrative poem of moderate length based<br>
on a legend told in the Mahabharata. Sri Aurobindo considered<br>
the story to be originally “one of the many symbolic myths<br>
of the Vedic cycle”. Bringing out its symbolism and charging<br>
it progressively with his own spiritual vision, he turned Savitri<br>
into the epic it is today.<br>
By the time it was published, some passages had gone<br>
through dozens of drafts. Sri Aurobindo explained how he<br>
wrote the poem: “I used Savitri as a means of ascension. I began<br>
with it on a certain mental level, each time I could reach a higher<br>
level I rewrote from that level. . . . In fact Savitri has not been<br>
regarded by me as a poem to be written and finished, but as a<br>
field of experimentation to see how far poetry could be written<br>
from one’s own yogic consciousness and how that could be<br>
made creative.”<br>
The following outline of the composition and publication<br>
of Savitri draws upon all existing manuscripts and other textual<br>
materials, supplemented by the author’s letters on the poem. In<br>
brief, Savitri took shape through three major phases.<br>
(1) Before 1920, Sri Aurobindo made a number of drafts of<br>
a narrative poem retelling in an original way the tale of Savitri<br>
and Satyavan. Its last version had a plan of eight books in two<br>
parts; the books were not divided into cantos. (2) In the 1930s,<br>
he set about converting this narrative poem into an epic. For a<br>
long time he concentrated on the description of Aswapati’s Yoga<br>
prior to the birth of Savitri, creating by 1945 a new Part One<br>
with three books and many cantos. (3) In the last phase, besides<br>
revising Part One for publication, he reworked and enlarged<br>
most of the books written in the first period. He added a book<br>
on the Yoga of Savitri, making twelve books and forty-nine<br>
cantos in all and completing Parts Two and Three.<br>
<br>
728<br>
The Composition of Savitri<br>
Sri Aurobindo read the Savitri-episode of the Mahabharata in<br>
Sanskrit while he was in Baroda. He expressed appreciation of<br>
its style in his “Notes on the Mahabharata”, written around<br>
1901. But a report that he worked on an English poem on the<br>
subject at this time is not supported by his own statements or<br>
any documents that survive. If there was a Baroda Savitri, which<br>
is doubtful, it was among the writings of which Sri Aurobindo<br>
wrote in 1933, “Most of all that has disappeared into the unknown in the whirlpools and turmoil of my political career.”<br>
Even assuming that such a poem was written in Baroda, for<br>
all practical purposes Savitri as we know it was commenced in<br>
Pondicherry.<br>
The opening of the first known version is dated “August<br>
8th 9th / 1916”. Further dates occur later on in the draft. From<br>
the death of Satyavan to the end of Savitri’s debate with Death,<br>
the manuscript is marked every few pages with dates from a<br>
three-day period, 17-19 October. After this, the consecutive narration breaks off and the notebook contains only disconnected<br>
passages. Some of these are sketches for the conclusion of the<br>
poem. Most of them go back over what was already written.<br>
They represent the beginning of the long process of rewriting<br>
which was to continue until 1950.<br>
This earliest surviving manuscript of Savitri shows every<br>
sign of being the first draft. It is one of the few versions that Sri<br>
Aurobindo dated. But even if precise dates cannot be assigned<br>
to them, the manuscripts of the poem can almost always be<br>
placed in a definite order after a careful comparison. This is<br>
because changes made when one draft was revised were usually<br>
incorporated in the next draft, which would then be further<br>
altered and most often expanded.<br>
Initially the poem was short enough not to require division<br>
into books or cantos. Its sections were separated only by blank<br>
lines. But soon Sri Aurobindo was dividing it into “Book I”,<br>
ending with the death of Satyavan, and “Book II”, recounting<br>
Savitri’s debate with and victory over Death. Next he adopted<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
<br>

<br>
a scheme of six cantos and an epilogue. The canto titles were:<br>
Love, Fate, Death, Night, Twilight and Day.<br>
After making a few drafts in cantos, he started substituting<br>
the word “book” for “canto”. There were now six books with<br>
the same names as the former cantos. Meanwhile the larger division had reappeared as two parts, “Earth” and “Beyond”. At<br>
first each part comprised three books, not counting the epilogue.<br>
But before long, the rapidly growing first book was broken up<br>
into two. The second book kept the name “Love”; the first was<br>
renamed “Quest”.<br>
A manuscript beginning with “Book I / Quest” has the title<br>
“Sâvithrı̂: A Tale and a Vision”. (In early versions, “S âvithrı̂”<br>
was the usual spelling of the heroine’s name.) Sri Aurobindo<br>
referred to this stage in the poem’s history in a letter of 1936:<br>
“Savitri was originally written many years ago before the<br>
Mother came [i.e., before the Mother’s final arrival in 1920], as a<br>
narrative poem in two parts, Part I Earth and Part II Beyond . . .<br>
each of four books — or rather Part II consisted of three books<br>
and an epilogue.”<br>
This was the plan of Savitri at the end of the first phase<br>
of its composition. But the last manuscript actually completed<br>
was in six cantos and an epilogue. After “books” replaced the<br>
“cantos” and the number of books increased, some books were<br>
worked over several times. Others were hardly touched. There<br>
is a partial draft of “Book III / Death”, for example; there is<br>
none from the stage when “Death” would have been the fourth<br>
book. After 1945 when Sri Aurobindo incorporated material<br>
from the early poem into what was by then a full-fledged epic,<br>
he sometimes went back to a manuscript of the six “cantos” as<br>
his starting-point.<br>
Savitri was apparently put aside during most of the 1920s, a<br>
period when Sri Aurobindo did little writing. The first evidence<br>
of its resumption is found in a letter of 1931. Here he speaks of a<br>
radical change in the conception and scope of the poem. Already<br>
the subtitle, “A Legend and a Symbol”, is present in his mind:<br>
“There is a previous draft, the result of the many retouchings of<br>
which somebody told you; but in that form it would not have<br>
<br>
730<br>
been a ‘magnum opus’ at all. Besides, it would have been a legend<br>
and not a symbol. I therefore started recasting the whole thing;<br>
only the best passages and lines of the old draft will remain,<br>
altered so as to fit into the new frame.”<br>
Throughout the thirties and early forties, it was primarily<br>
Book One that was affected by this recasting. At first this book<br>
was still called “Quest”. It extended as far as Savitri’s arrival at<br>
“The Destined Meeting-Place” (the eventual title of Book Five,<br>
Canto One). But in the early thirties, the brief description of the<br>
Yoga of King Aswapati near the beginning swelled to hundreds<br>
of lines. What was to become the second and longest book of<br>
the epic, “The Book of the Traveller of the Worlds”, began to<br>
take shape.<br>
In a letter of 1936, Sri Aurobindo mentioned a new first<br>
book, the “Book of Birth”, carved out of the overgrown<br>
“Quest”. Another letter of the same year reveals the internal<br>
structure of this book. It was “divided into sections and the<br>
larger sections into subsections”. Up to this point, the books<br>
had been divided only into passages separated by spaces, as<br>
many cantos are now. As these sections increased in length, they<br>
were recognised as formal units and began to be named and<br>
numbered. Section marks (§) were usually put before and after<br>
the numbers.<br>
The Book of Birth, whose last section related the birth and<br>
childhood of Savitri, was still disproportionately long and was<br>
constantly growing. Early in 1937, Sri Aurobindo expressed<br>
his intention of rearranging the opening books into a Book of<br>
Beginnings and a Book of Birth and Quest.<br>
Progress on the poem was intermittent in the thirties due<br>
to Sri Aurobindo’s heavy load of correspondence. From the end<br>
of 1938 to mid-1940, work on Savitri was suspended. But on 6<br>
September 1942, a 110-page draft of the Book of Beginnings was<br>
completed. The fourth of its eight sections, “The Ascent through<br>
the Worlds”, accounted for more than half the total length and<br>
had twelve subsections. In the next version, this section became<br>
Book Two with the title it now has. The last four sections were<br>
grouped into Book Three, “The Book of the Divine Mother”.<br>
<br>

<br>
The second phase in the composition of Savitri reached its<br>
culmination when the first three books were written out in two<br>
columns on large sheets. Many passages, including the whole of<br>
the first and third books and much of the second, went through<br>
two or more drafts in this form. The last complete manuscript<br>
is dated “May 7. 1944” at the end.<br>
It was while revising this manuscript that Sri Aurobindo<br>
reintroduced the word “canto” which he had not used since an<br>
early stage, applying it to the former “sections” of the books.<br>
At this point the third section of Book One, “The Yoga of the<br>
King”, was turned into Cantos 3-5 with their present titles. The<br>
three opening books were for the first time identified as “Part<br>
One”.<br>
The two-column manuscript is the last continuous version<br>
of Part One in Sri Aurobindo’s hand. But he went on reworking<br>
Book One and passages throughout Book Two. For this purpose<br>
he began using small note-pads whose sheets, containing new or<br>
rewritten matter, could be torn out and pinned to the principal<br>
manuscript at the appropriate places.<br>
By the mid-1940s, Sri Aurobindo’s eyesight was failing and<br>
his handwriting was becoming less and less legible. He needed<br>
the help of a scribe in order to put Books 1-3 into a finished form,<br>
take up the long-neglected later books, and prepare Savitri for<br>
publication. This third phase of its composition saw periods of<br>
rapid and decisive progress. But it was to be interrupted the<br>
month before Sri Aurobindo’s passing, a little short of definitive<br>
completion.<br>
Much had still to be done with the first part. Sri Aurobindo<br>
asked the scribe to read the last version to him. After dictating<br>
changes, insertions and transpositions, he had his assistant copy<br>
it into a large ledger. This copy was meticulously revised before<br>
being given to another disciple for typing. The typescript in<br>
its turn was read out to Sri Aurobindo and similarly revised.<br>
Heavily revised pages were often retyped. The same process was<br>
sometimes repeated, especially in the later cantos of Book Two,<br>
where three typed copies exist.<br>
Savitri now began to appear in print, though not yet in its<br>
<br>
732<br>
final form. The first and third books were brought out canto by<br>
canto from August 1946 to February 1948 in journals connected<br>
with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. They were also published in<br>
fascicles identical to the journal instalments. The second book<br>
was issued in 1947 and 1948 in two large fascicles.<br>
Differences between the typescripts and the printed texts<br>
show that proofs of the latter must have been revised in detail<br>
by Sri Aurobindo. Afterwards a copy of each fascicle was read to<br>
him. Even at this advanced stage, he made extensive alterations<br>
and added new lines and passages.<br>
Meanwhile he had turned his attention to the later books.<br>
The plan of Parts Two and Three resembled that of the pre-1920<br>
poem, whose books had been divided into “Earth” (Quest, Love,<br>
Fate, Death) and “Beyond” (Night, Twilight, Day, Epilogue). By<br>
1945, however, most of these books had remained untouched for<br>
twenty-five years. Everything written under what Sri Aurobindo<br>
termed in 1934 “the old insufficient inspiration” would have to<br>
be thoroughly recast. Moreover, a new book had been conceived:<br>
The Book of Yoga. Destined to become one of the longest in the<br>
epic, six of its seven cantos were still to be drafted.<br>
The material in the Book of Birth and Quest had for a long<br>
time been included in Book One. As a result it had gone through<br>
several drafts in the 1930s, while other books lay dormant. The<br>
last book to be set aside, it was also the first to be taken up<br>
again. One manuscript of it precedes the 1942 draft of the Book<br>
of Beginnings. The final version was evidently written within a<br>
year or so of this. Since much work had already been done on it,<br>
this book needed less modification than others. Yet especially in<br>
the first two cantos, Sri Aurobindo dictated substantial changes<br>
and additions when he revised the manuscript and typescript.<br>
The Book of Love shared to some extent in the good fortune<br>
of the previous book during the thirties and early forties. But<br>
the last version in Sri Aurobindo’s hand, in the notebook which<br>
starts with his final manuscript of Book Four, breaks off in the<br>
middle of the second canto. The continuation is in the scribe’s<br>
hand. It was copied there probably two or three years later when<br>
the systematic revision of the later books had been undertaken.<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
<br>

<br>
The remainder of this notebook contains the scribe’s copy<br>
of Books Six, Nine and Ten, reworked from the corresponding<br>
books in the old poem, expanded, divided into cantos and renamed “The Book of Fate”, “The Book of Eternal Night” and<br>
“The Book of the Double Twilight”. Once Sri Aurobindo had<br>
done enough with Books Four and Five for the time being, it<br>
appears that he took up these three books one after the other.<br>
After Book Six, he skipped to Book Nine, postponing extensive<br>
work on Books Seven and Eight. However, he may have revised<br>
slightly the versions of the original third book or canto, “Death”,<br>
on which Book Seven, Canto One and the present Book of Death<br>
are based.<br>
Drafts of “Fate”, “Night” and “Twilight” had been written<br>
on one side of loose sheets of paper, like other cantos or books<br>
in several early versions of Savitri. This facilitated the complex<br>
process of revision which was now set in motion. When the<br>
space between lines and in the margins was filled up, the backs<br>
of the pages were available. In extreme cases, whole cantos were<br>
written on the reverse sides of the pages with little relation to<br>
what was on the front.<br>
Sri Aurobindo drafted many passages in small note-pads of<br>
the type used for Part One. Lines for Books Five and Nine and<br>
large portions of Books Six and Ten were written in this way.<br>
Canto Two of Book Six was almost entirely new. The passages<br>
drafted for it were transferred by the scribe to another note-pad,<br>
with changes dictated by Sri Aurobindo at the time.<br>
The metamorphosis which the Book of Fate underwent included the introduction of the Queen: some of Aswapati’s later<br>
speeches in the old version were now given to her, and her long<br>
speech at the beginning of Canto Two was composed. Sri Aurobindo worked on this book in 1946 and brought it close to<br>
its final form. But he was to return to it at the end and add<br>
significantly to the second canto.<br>
An early manuscript of “Night” was substantially revised<br>
and turned into the two cantos of Book Nine. But in this instance<br>
Sri Aurobindo seems to have found the pre-1920 version more<br>
adequate than usual. He left it intact to a greater extent than in<br>
<br>
734<br>
the case of other books on which he bestowed his full attention<br>
in the 1940s. Only the Book of Death and the Epilogue stayed<br>
closer to their original shape, but he always intended to come<br>
back to these.<br>
On the other hand, old drafts of “Twilight” formed merely<br>
a starting-point for the four cantos of Book Ten. The speeches<br>
of Savitri and Death were refashioned, rearranged in their order,<br>
and new ones inserted. As he proceeded from one canto to the<br>
next, Sri Aurobindo added longer and longer passages that were<br>
quite new. The first section of Canto One, the long speech of<br>
Death which ends Canto Two, all but the last few pages of<br>
Canto Three, and most of Canto Four — especially its second<br>
half, where Savitri finally triumphs over Death — owe little or<br>
nothing to any early version.<br>
In a letter of 22 April 1947, Sri Aurobindo summarised the<br>
status of the various books of the second and third parts. Books<br>
Four, Five, Six, Nine and Ten had by then “been completed, in<br>
a general way, with a sufficient finality of the whole form but<br>
subject to final changes in detail”. The other four books were<br>
far from even a provisional completion.<br>
A “drastic recasting of the last two books” was felt to be<br>
needed and “only a part of the eleventh” had been subjected to<br>
that process. But a yet larger task lay ahead, the splitting up of<br>
the original Book of Death and the writing of the new cantos<br>
that would go into the Book of Yoga. In his letter of April 1947<br>
Sri Aurobindo did not say what he planned to do next. But there<br>
are reasons to believe that, rather than going on directly from<br>
Book Ten to Book Eleven, he now retraced his steps to Book<br>
Seven.<br>
The description of Savitri’s Yoga, complementing that of<br>
Aswapati’s Yoga in Part One, was drafted in a thick notebook<br>
whose first hundred pages are filled with drafts for Book Ten,<br>
Canto Four. By March 1947, even before finishing the tenth<br>
book, Sri Aurobindo had begun to use this notebook for preliminary work on Book Seven. The scribe was not asked to<br>
copy the semi-legible handwriting of the draft. Instead, Sri Aurobindo dictated to him the lines he had jotted down, often in a<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
<br>

<br>
somewhat different form. The dictated version was extensively<br>
revised before a typed copy was made.<br>
The Book of Yoga had four cantos at first. But the second,<br>
“The Parable of the Finding of the Soul”, grew to an inordinate<br>
length. When the typescript was revised, it was broken up into<br>
Cantos 2-5, from “The Parable of the Search for the Soul” to<br>
“The Finding of the Soul”. Revision of the typed copy was so<br>
elaborate in places (as elsewhere, especially in Book Six, Canto<br>
Two and in Book Eleven) that sometimes there was not enough<br>
room on the page. The scribe would then write on separate slips<br>
of paper, attaching as many as ten of these to a single page of<br>
the typescript.<br>
Canto One of Book Seven has a different background. Early<br>
in the evolution of Savitri, the third canto of the poem (later, the<br>
third book) was called “Death”. It described the year leading<br>
up to Satyavan’s death as well as the fatal day itself. The latest<br>
version, with the heading “Book III”, is incomplete and stops<br>
before the last day. Sri Aurobindo used this manuscript as far<br>
as it goes when he put Book Seven, Canto One into its present<br>
form.<br>
The second half of an earlier “Canto III” had to be used as<br>
the manuscript for Book Eight. It was revised slightly near the<br>
beginning and a substantial passage was dictated at the end. Sri<br>
Aurobindo apparently intended to return to the Book of Death,<br>
but this was not to be.<br>
On 20 July 1948 he was compelled to admit, “even Savitri<br>
has very much slowed down and I am only making the last<br>
revisions of the First Part already completed; the other two parts<br>
are just now in cold storage.” When the later parts were taken<br>
up again, the most important task remaining was evidently to<br>
bring the almost untouched eleventh book up to the level of<br>
what preceded it. The old “Book VII / Day” on which it would<br>
be based was among the best-developed portions of the early<br>
poem. But after thirty years, Sri Aurobindo had more to say at<br>
the climax of Savitri.<br>
There was also the Epilogue; but the contemplated revision of this must have seemed less essential to the total design.<br>
<br>
736<br>
Although a few pages of an early version were significantly<br>
retouched at some stage, the concluding two sections of the<br>
Epilogue stayed almost exactly as they were. Thus the closing<br>
pages of the epic, like most of Book Eight, remained as a sample<br>
of the style in which Savitri was originally written.<br>
Near the end of his life, Sri Aurobindo’s eyesight was so<br>
poor that he no longer wrote at all. He made no more drafts for<br>
Savitri and the work proceeded entirely by dictation. Virtually<br>
the whole revision of “The Book of Everlasting Day” was done<br>
in this purely oral manner and may be inferred to belong to this<br>
late period. There exist only a few pages of drafts for it in Sri<br>
Aurobindo’s hand, found in note-pads he used around 1946. He<br>
was probably referring to these when he wrote in 1947 that he<br>
had already recast “part of the eleventh” book.<br>
Book Eleven culminates in the longest continuous dictated<br>
passage in Savitri. The passage was written by the scribe in a separate note-pad and seems to have no antecedent in any previous<br>
draft. This is the section which begins on p. 702 with “Descend<br>
to life . . . ”, and ends at the bottom of p. 710 with “This earthly<br>
life become the life divine.” Regarding Sri Aurobindo’s dictation<br>
in Book Eleven, the scribe reports that “line after line began to<br>
flow from his lips like a smooth and gentle stream and it was on<br>
the next day that a revision was done to get the link for further<br>
continuation.”<br>
By this time, cantos of Parts Two and Three were coming out<br>
in journal instalments and fascicles like those of Part One. Most<br>
of the cantos of Books Four, Five, Six and Nine were published<br>
in this way in 1949-50. Unlike the fascicles of the first part, they<br>
were not revised afterwards by Sri Aurobindo.<br>
But in 1948, an extract from Book Six, Canto Two had<br>
already been printed in the Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual. An<br>
offprint of this was read to Sri Aurobindo and the changes he<br>
dictated were incorporated in a retyped copy. The painstaking<br>
revision of this second typescript was reportedly the last work<br>
he did on Savitri. A short paragraph before the concluding description of Narad’s departure was the final passage to receive<br>
detailed attention in November 1950, less than a month before<br>
<br>
Note on the Text<br>
<br>
737<br>
<br>
Sri Aurobindo’s passing. The thirteen-line paragraph was expanded to the seventy-two lines beginning “Queen, strive no<br>
more to change the secret will. . . . ”<br>
Editions of Savitri<br>
Sri Aurobindo revised the proofs of the first edition of Part<br>
One, making numerous final changes and adding more than a<br>
hundred new lines. In 1950, Part One of Savitri appeared in<br>
book form. Parts Two and Three could not be similarly revised.<br>
They came out in 1951 in a second volume, thus completing the<br>
first edition.<br>
The second edition was issued in 1954 in one volume under<br>
the imprint of the Sri Aurobindo International University Centre.<br>
Some obvious errors in the text of the first edition were emended<br>
at this time. A few of these were evidently due to the mishearing<br>
of Sri Aurobindo’s dictation.<br>
In 1968, the first edition of Part One was reprinted with<br>
some new textual corrections. The third complete edition (1970)<br>
contained further emendations. Comprising Volumes 28 and<br>
29 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library, it was also<br>
brought out as a single volume in a reduced format. This was<br>
reprinted a number of times between 1973 and 1990. Several<br>
typographical and other errors were rectified in the 1976 impression.<br>
The fourth, critically revised edition appeared in 1993 and<br>
is reproduced here. This edition was the outcome of a systematic<br>
comparison of the printed text of Savitri with the manuscripts.<br>
Each line was traced through all stages of copying, typing and<br>
printing in which errors could have occurred. Readings found to<br>
have come about through inaccurate transcription or misprinting were corrected. Accidentally omitted lines were restored to<br>
the text. This has resulted in a very slight increase in the length<br>
of the poem to its present 23,837 lines.<br>

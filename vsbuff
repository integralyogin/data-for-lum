Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted. ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson 
I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to work. ~ Pearl S. Buck 
Scientists become method oriented rather than problem oriented. Stop doing experiments for a while and think. ~ Platt (1964), quoted in Pigliucci (2002:92)
Even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist. ~ John Maynard Keynes 
Academics fight over resources much more readily than over principles. ~ https://twitter.com/molpopgen/status/512340805923508224
Must we geneticists become bacteriologists, physiological chemists and physicists, simultaneously with being zoologists and botanists? Let us hope so. ~  H.J. Muller (1922) 
The ground rule—or perhaps doctrine would be a better term—is that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should be used only where it is really necessary. ~ G.C. Williams  
A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. ~ Emerson 
The History of Science has suffered greatly from the use by teachers of second-hand material, and the consequent obliteration of the circumstances and the intellectual atmosphere in which the great discoveries of the past were made. A first-hand study is always instructive, and often ... full of surprises. ~ R.A. Fisher, 1955 
The natural phenomena of the evolutionary history of man claim an entirely peculiar place in the wide range of the scientific study of nature. There is surely no subject of scientific investigation touching man more closely, or in the knowledge of which he is more deeply concerned, than the human organism itself; and of all the various branches of the science of man, or anthropology, the history of his natural evolution should excite his highest interest. ~ Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), The Evolution of Man (1892), p. 2
The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms. ~ Albert Einstein
If your idea of happiness has to do with someone else changing what they say, what they do, you are in for a fucking hard ass road. ~ RuPaul 
The tendency of modern scientific teaching is to neglect the great books, to lay far too much stress upon relatively unimportant modern work, and to present masses of detail of doubtful truth and questionable weight in such a way as to obscure principles. ~ R.A. Fisher 
Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigour should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere. ~ William S. Anglin 
The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. ~ Bertrand Russell 
He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever. ~ Chinese Proverb
Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference. ~ Mark Twain
The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution. ~ Bertrand Russell 
As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired from ideas coming from 'reality', it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely l'art pour l'art. This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much 'abstract' inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque the danger signal is up. It would be easy to give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the very high baroque, but this would be too technical. In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the reinjection of more or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this is a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject, and that this will remain so in the future. ~ John von Neumann 
An ounce of algebra is worth a ton of verbal argument. ~ J.B.S Haldane 
The business of the statistician is to catalyze the scientific learning process. ~ George E. P. Box 
To do science is to search for repeated patterns, not simply to accumulate the facts. ~  Robert MacArthur, 1972  
You go to war with the data you have, not the data you wish you had. ~ Richard McElreath
Just about five-eighths (of a century) ago there was a sharp discontinuity: algebra began to appear on the pages of the statistician's, journals. The pioneering work of Karl Pearson spread out in many directions; that of Student spread out in many others, including the analysis of economic time series. Since that time the tools of the statistician have been sharpened on the grindstone of algebra and hammered out on the anvil of mathematical models. We learned rapidly that, to a far greater extent than we had dared to think, one could use data to deal both with the uncertainties of nature and with the uncertainties of data-based results. ~ John Tukey 
Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise. ~ John Tukey, 1962 
I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the law of frequency of error [the Gaussian distribution]. The law would have been personified by the Greeks if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and complete self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion.  The larger the mob, the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of unreason. ~ Sir Francis Galton, 1889
I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted. ~ Charles Darwin
  Regularization saves your bacon. ~ Richard McElreath 
I believe that, in the end, it is *applications* which justify mathematics. The 'artistic' justification of pure mathematics in terms of intrinsic qualities like elegance and generality rings rather hollow in my ears when I compare the best mathematics with the greatest music. ~ L. C. G. Rogers and Davis Williams in *Diffusions, Markov Processes, and Martingales*.
But I am very poorly today and very stupid and hate everybody and everything. ~ Charles Darwin 
If you want to do something really new, go back to points in the past where there was a neat idea that never really caught on, and follow the path of that idea to see where it leads. ~ approximate quote from Marvin Minksy, from http://aurellem.org/thoughts/html/sussman-reading-list.html 
It is difficult to imagine that the blind play of genes could produce man. ~ G.C. Williams. 
Those who read own the world, and those who watch television lose it. ~ Werner Herzog
Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. ~ Charles Darwin (The Origin) 
Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. ~ Donald E. Knuth (in the forward of A = B) 
Inventive genius requires pleasurable mental activity as a condition for its vigorous exercise. 'Necessity is the mother of invention' is a silly proverb. 'Necessity is the mother of futile dodges' is much nearer to the truth. The basis of the growth of modern invention is science, and science is almost wholly the outgrowth of pleasurable intellectual curiosity. - A. N. Whitehead (quote in Concrete Mathematics)
We may say that, before Maxwell, Physical Reality, in so far as it was to represent the process of nature, was thought of as consisting in material particles, whose variations consist only in movements governed by partial differential equations. Since Maxwell's time, Physical Reality has been thought of as represented by continuous fields, governed by partial differential equations, and not capable of any mechanical interpretation. This change in the conception of Reality is the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton. ~ Einstein 
Thought is only a flash between two long nights, but this flash is everything. ~ Henri Poincare 
Species are merely those strongly marked races or local forms which, when in contact, do not intermix, and when inhabiting distinct areas are generally regarded to have had a separate origin, and to be incapable of producing a fertile hybrid offspring.  But as the test of hybridity cannot be applied in one case in ten thousand, and even if it could be applied, would prove nothing, since it is founded on an assumption of the very question to be decided - and as the test of origin is in every case inapplicable - and as, further, the test of non-intermixture is useless, except in those rare cases where the most closely allied species are found inhabiting the same area, it will be evident that we have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called "true species" from the several modes of variation here pointed out, and into which they so often pass by an insensible gradation. ~  A.R. Wallace (1865; "On the phenomena of variation and geographical distribution as illustrated by the Papilionidae of
the Malayan region", p. 12)
There is a strong and widely held belief that all organisms are perfect and that everything within them is there for a function. Believers ascribe to the Darwinian natural selection process a fastidious prescience that it cannot possible have and some go so far as to think that patently useless features of existing organisms are there as an investment for the future ...  Even today, long after the discovery of repetitive sequences and introns, pointing out that 25% of our genome consists of millions of copies of one boring sequence, fails to move audiences. They are all convinced by the argument that if this DNA were totally useless, natural selection would already have removed it. Consequently, it must have a function that still remains to be discovered. Some think that it could even be there for evolution of the future—that is, to allow the creation of new genes. As this was done in the past, they argue, why not in the future? ... Some years ago I noticed that there are two kinds of rubbish in the world and that most languages have different words to distinguish them. There is the rubbish we keep, which is junk, and the rubbish we throw away, which is garbage. The excess DNA in our genomes is junk, and it is there because it is harmless, as well as being useless, and because the molecular processes generating extra DNA outpace those getting rid of it. Were the extra DNA to become disadvantageous, it would become subject to selection, just as junk that takes up too much space, or is beginning to smell, is instantly converted to garbage. ~ Sydney Brenner 
Using R is a bit akin to smoking. The beginning is difficult, one may get headaches and even gag the first few times. But in the long run, it becomes pleasurable and even addictive. Yet, deep down, for those willing to be honest, there is something not fully healthy in it. ~ Francois Pinard 
A genuine understanding of the key concepts and principles of the probability theory is essential for any work in stochastic processes. These concepts are simple, but treacherously so. There is probably no branch of mathematics in which it is so easy to advance plausible sounding arguments that are in fact wrong! ~ Cox & Davison, 1994, p. 25 
Maybe it’s because I was raised as a Protestant and became an environmentalist, but I’ve long been struck by the spiritual kinship of environmentalism and New England Puritanism. Both belief systems are haunted by the feeling that simply to be human is to be guilty. In the case of environmentalism, the feeling is grounded in scientific fact. ~ Jonathan Franzen, http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/carbon-capture
What is found in biology is mechanisms, mechanisms built with chemical components and that are often modified by other, later, mechanisms added to the earlier ones. While Occam's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research. While DNA could be claimed to be both simple and elegant, it must be remembered that DNA almost certainly originated fairly close to the origin of life when things were necessarily simple or they would not have got going.  Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved. It might be thought, therefore, that evolutionary arguments would play a large part in guiding biological research, but this is far from the case. It is difficult enough to study what is happening now. To figure out exactly what happened in evolution is even more difficult. Thus evolutionary achievements can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research, but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood. ~ Francis Crick 
Ronald Fisher in England was an advocate of eugenics, and both he and Sewall Wright in America formulated the principle of natural selection as a process of increasing, from generation to generation, the average fitness of members of a breeding population. Yet these formulations make no predictions about a general progress of species. This may seem odd, since the process of natural selection is supposed to make organisms more fit for their environment. So why does evolution not result in a general increase of the fitness of life to the external world? Wouldn’t that be progress? The reason that there is no general progress is that the environments in which particular species live are themselves changing and, relative to the organisms, are usually getting worse. So most of natural selection is concerned with keeping up. Certainly quite new kinds of making a living have been occasionally exploited in evolution, but every species eventually becomes extinct (99.9 percent already have) and no way of making a living will be around forever.4 Judging from the fossil record a typical mammalian species lasts roughly ten million years, so we might expect to last another nine million unless, as a consequence of our immense ability to manipulate the physical world, we either extinguish ourselves a good deal sooner or invent some extraordinary way to significantly postpone the inevitable. ~ Richard Lewontin, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/10/20/the-wars-over-evolution/ 
"Great" scientists are those who, like Newton, make laws that apply universally, while lesser ones spend their lives dissecting particular phenomena. ~ Richard Lewontin  
That a theoretical formulation is desirable because it makes it easier and more efficient to write more articles and books giving simple explanations for phenomena that are complex and diverse seems a strange justification for work that claims to be scientific. It confuses "understanding" in the weak sense of making coherent and comprehensible statements about the real world with “understanding” that means making correct statements about nature. It makes the investigation of material nature into an intellectual game, disarming us in our struggle to maintain science against mysticism. ~ Richard Lewontin 
It is, I think, particularly in times of acknowledged crisis that scientists have turned to philosophical analysis as a device for unlocking the riddles of their field. ~ Kuhn, 1970, p. 88  
If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking. ~ Leslie Lamport
In a sexual population, each genotype is unique, never to recur. The life expectancy of a genotype is a single generation. In contrast, the population of genes endures. ~ James F. Crow 
"It is an old maxim of mine," said Holmes, "that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." "Perhaps," said Watson, skeptically, "You may have convinced me as to the motive, but you are yet to explain how it is done." ~ Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of Four
If the central dogma is true, and if it is also true that nucleic acids are the only means whereby information is transmitted between generations, this has crucial implications for evolution. It would imply that all evolutionary novelty requires changes in nucleic acids, and that these changes – mutations – are essentially accidental and non-adaptive in nature. Changes elsewhere – in the egg cytoplasm, in materials transmitted through the placenta, in the mother's milk – might alter the development of the child, but, unless the changes were in nucleic acids, they would have no long-term evolutionary effects. ~ Maynard Smith 
Molecular clocks are like Santa Claus: everyone wants to believe in them, but no one really does. ~ Sanderson (2015), H. Brad Shaffer, pers. comm. 
It is generally accepted that the behaviour characteristic of a species is just as much the product of evolution as the morphology. ~ W.D. Hamilton 
Under the circumstances that a genus is either now or has recently been in a mutable state it would seem likely that natural selection would not yet have had time to weed out all the forms doomed to perish through lack of adaptation or insufficient vigor. ~ Leonas L. Burlingame, 1921 
No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he make due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the many beings which live around us. ~ Darwin (1859, p. 6)  
The scientist explains the world by successive approximations. ~ Hubble  
Variation is the hard reality . . . Means and medians are the abstractions. ~ Stephen Jay Gould
I would like to mention rather anecdotally that in the last three or four years the fog of quantitative variation, which I had assumed to be the result of segregation at a large number of loci, has gradually begun to clear as I have recognized individual segregations almost as personal friends. ~ Alan Robertson in "The Nature of Quantitative Genetic Variation"
No aphorism is more frequently repeated in connection with field trials, than that we must ask Nature few questions, or, ideally, one question, at a time. The writer is convinced that this view is wholly mistaken. Nature, he suggests, will best respond to a logical and carefully thought out questionnaire ; indeed, if we ask her a single question, she will often refuse to answer until some other topic has been discussed. ~ R.A. Fisher in "The Arrangement of Field Experiments"
I have had the growing suspicion that in revealing the great variety of genic forms segregating in populations we have given the right answer to the wrong question. That is, the question was never really, How much genetic variation is there…? but rather, What is the nature of genetic variation for fitness in a population? ~ RC Lewontin, 1974; p. x 
For my team, I'll take the younger Darwin of the first edition, when the swing of his selectionist bat was true. ~ David Queller, "The Spaniels of St. Marx and the Panglossian Paradox: A Critique of a Rhetorical Programme", 1995
As Samuel Butler so truly said: 'To me it seems that the "Origin of Variation", whatever it is, is the only true "Origin of Species".' ~ W. Bateson, 1909 (in R.A. Fisher, 1930)
Man in many respects may be compared with those animals which have long been domesticated. ~ Charles Darwin, 1871 
It is suggested that this loss of fitness is the price paid by a species for its capacity for further evolution. ~ Haldane, 1937, p. 349 
Yes, Dan [Hartl], [you can join my lab] provided you understand that population genetics is a recondite field that will never be of great interest except to a small group of specialists. ~ James Crow to Dan Hartl, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/science/james-f-crow-population-genetics-pioneer-dies-at-95.html 
Speaking of truly brilliant people fucking up, let's start with Galton. ~ Michael Turelli
Any misfortune 'that lies outside the sphere of choice' should be considered an opportunity to strengthen our resolve, not an excuse to weaken it. ~ https://aeon.co/essays/why-stoicism-is-one-of-the-best-mind-hacks-ever-devised
This procedure is based on the principle of ergodicity, which says that averaging a random variable of a stationary stochastic process over time leads to the same result as averaging this quantity at any given time point over different realizations of the process. ~ Kim and Stephan, 2000; nice definition of ergodicity.
 A scientific man ought to have no wishes, no affections, - a mere heart of stone. ~ Charles Darwin 
  The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have not viewed the world. ~ Alexander von Humboldt 
 The time in which men believed that science could be advanced by the mere collection of facts has long passed away: we know that it is not necessary to accumulate a vast number of miscellaneous facts, or to make as it were a catalogue of them; but we know that it is necessary to establish facts which, when grouped together in the light of a theory, will enable us to acquire a certain degree of insight into some natural phenomenon. ~ Weismann, 1889 
No! Biology is not obliged to wait until Physics and Chemistry are completely finished; nor have we to wait for the investigation of the phenomena of heredity until the physiology of the cell is complete. Instead of comparing the progress of science to a building, I should prefer to compare it to a mining operation, undertaken in order to open up a freely branching lode. Such a lode must not be attacked from one point alone, but from many points simultaneously. From some of these we should quickly reach the deep‐seated parts of the lode, from others we should only reach its superficial parts; but from every point some knowledge of the complex tout ensemtle of the lode would be gained. And the more numerous the points of attack, the more complete would be the knowledge acquired, for valuable insight will be obtained in every place where the work is carried on with discretion and perseverance.  ~ Weismann, 1889 
To go on investigating without the guidance of theories, is like attempting to walk in a thick mist without a track and without a compass.  ~ Weismann, 1889 
Why is thought being a secretion of brain, more wonderful than gravity a property of matter? It is our arrogance, our admiration of ourselves. ~ Charles Darwin, in this transmutation notebook.
Photography is a strong tool, a propaganda device, and a weapon for the defense of the environment...and therefore for the fostering of a healthy human race and even very likely for its survival. ~ Eliot Porter  
What is this? What is going on here? You are a heathen. ~ STF about my Chrome tab use.
Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting any peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation. ~ Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, 1859 
Something must happen to 'stir up their heredities,' as I am fond of saying--to excite in them the variability that normally lies dormant... When you stir up the heredity of any living thing too much it is like stirring up an ant-hill--you find the results much more startling and unsettling than useful or helpful. ~ Luther Burbank 
If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. ~ Marcus Aurelius (Meditations) 
Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions--not outside. ~ Marcus Aurelius, Book 9 Verse 13 
A related and perhaps also temporary feature of the movement is its anti-intellectual style. Intellectuals by definition are people who take ideas seriously for their own sake. Whether or not a theory is true or false is important to them independently of any practical applications it may have. They have, as Richard Hofstadter has pointed out, an attitude to ideas that is at once playful and pious. But in the radical movement, the intellectual ideal of knowledge for its own sake is rejected. Knowledge is seen as valuable only as a basis for action, and it is not even very valuable there. Far more important than what one knows is how one feels. We have had in this movement a politics of feeling and not a politics of reason. Books which emphasize feeling, such as R. D. Laing's The Politics of Experience, and N. O. Brown's Love's Body appear to be more influential than conventional revolutionary tracts. ~ John R. Searle, The Campus War, 1971
There is nothing so wretched or foolish as to anticipate misfortunes. What madness it is in your expecting evil before it arrives!  ~ Seneca—Epistolae Ad Lucilium. XCVIII; see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/04/never-happened/
The cry of the cicada Gives us no sign That presently it will die. ~ Japanese haiku 
He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion… Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them…he must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form. ~ John Stuart Mill, "On Liberty"
Yeah, that is the fundamental issue of academia.  Stuff is only worthwhile if it is painful. ~ KRT 
The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter. ~ James Jean
I incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind. ~ James Jean 
Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy — to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. ~ Kierkegaard, Either/Or
